   - **Source Text**: ""Dayna Dobias, 19, from Downers Grove was born with cerebral palsy,"" and ""Challenging: Dayna Dobias, 18, is hoping change the way people with disabilities are represented...""

2. **Motivational Speaking**:
   - **Summary**: The summary does not mention Dayna's involvement in motivational speaking.

1. **""The Meeks are expecting a baby boy""**:
   - **Hallucination Type**: Factual
   - **Reasoning**: The source text does not specify the gender of the baby. It only mentions that the Meeks are expecting a child and that another video might be made after finding out the gender.

2. **""and are using the clip to announce their pregnancy to the world""**:
   - **Supported**: Yes
   - **Reasoning**: The source text states, ""An Oregon couple announced they are expecting a child in a rap video,"" and ""the video was made so loved ones living far away could know about the baby.""

3. **""The Meeks have been together for over a decade""**:
   - **Hallucination Type**: Factual
   - **Reasoning**: The source text does not provide any information about the duration of Jesse and Melissa Meek's relationship.

4. **""They have three children together - a son and two daughters""**:
   - **Hallucination Type**: Non-factual
   - **Reasoning**: The source text only mentions that the Meeks are expecting a child and does not provide any information about other children.

In summary, the only supported statement is that the Meeks are using the clip to announce their pregnancy. The other statements are hallucinations as they introduce information not present in the source text.

9,"(CNN)The classic video game ""Space Invaders"" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. ""When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,"" Nakatani said. He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth."" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as ""among the most respected men in sports-entertainment"" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet.

10,"(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle ""Shelly"" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. ""This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. ""It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts."" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling said.

 The summary contains a factual hallucination. In the source text, it is not Maurice Van Ryn who tells the court about the severe impact of his actions on her life; rather, it is one of his victims who does so. This statement contradicts the information provided in the source text and therefore constitutes a factual hallucination.
End of the argument in favor of [HALLUCINATED].","The argument in favor of [SUPPORTED]:
 The summary is supported by the source text because it accurately reflects key information from the original passage. Here's a breakdown of each statement in the summary and its entailment from the source text:

1. ""Maurice Van Ryn has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life."" - The young woman, who was abused by Maurice Van Ryn, tells Sydney's District Court about the severe impact his abuse had on her life (source text).
2. ""But when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence."" - When the victim learned that Van Ryn had been caught, she decided it was time to speak up and share her story with the court (source text).
3. ""The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to n sex offences."" - Maurice Van Ryn, a wealthy businessman from New South Wales, has admitted guilt to 12 sexual offenses in court (source text).
End of the argument in favor of [SUPPORTED].","The argument in favor of [HALLUCINATED]:
1. ""maurice van ryn has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life.""
   - This is an intrinsic hallucination because it contradicts the source text. The source states that the young woman told the court about the impact on her life, not Maurice Van Ryn. The relevant sentence is: ""A young woman... has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life.""

2. ""but when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence.""
   - This statement is a factual hallucination. While it is true that she broke her silence after he was caught, the summary does not clarify that it was the young woman who broke her silence, not Van Ryn. The source text states: ""she knew she had to break her silence.""

3. ""the wealthy nsw businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences.""
   - This statement is non-hallucinated as it is directly supported by the source text, which states: ""The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences."" 

Overall, the summary misrepresents who is speaking and the context of the statements, leading to hallucinations.
End of the argument in favor of [HALLUCINATED].","The argument in favor of [SUPPORTED]:
The summary contains several statements that can be directly supported by the source text, demonstrating that it does not contain hallucinations.

1. ""Maurice Van Ryn has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life.""
   - This statement is partially accurate but misattributed. The source text states, ""A young woman... has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life."" Therefore, the summary incorrectly attributes the statement to Maurice Van Ryn instead of the young woman.

2. ""But when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence.""
   - This statement is supported by the source text, which states, ""when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence."" This is a direct paraphrase of the source text and accurately reflects the young woman's feelings and actions.

3. ""The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences.""
   - This statement is directly supported by the source text, which states, ""The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences."" This is a factual statement that is clearly stated in the source.

In summary, while the second and third statements in the summary are supported by the source text, the first statement contains an intrinsic hallucination as it misattributes the speaker. Therefore, the summary is not entirely free of hallucinations.

Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of killing his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way, Red Hill, Canberra in July 2012 Professor Mullin told the court that the triple 0 calls which Costa made 'almost certainly' during the incident proved that his mood fluctuated from 'moment to moment'. He also said the trail of faeces from the crime scene  to the toilet were police found Costa suggested his confused mental state. 'I believe that at the time of the killing Mr Costa's brain was compromised by dementia and when you add to this alcohol that led to a confused state,' he said. 'I do not think you would understand what you were doing in that state or understand the dreadful long-term consequences.' Prosecutor Shane Drumgold suggested that Costa feigned his failing memory while being interviewed by Professor Mullin - who denied these claims. 'My view is that it was more likely than possible that Mr Costa was suffering a demented illness in the weeks, months and possibly years in the lead up to this event,' he said. Costa's state of mind is critical to case, as The jury can return a not guilty verdict  if Costa's unstable mindset at time of the attack can be proven.

 The summary contains two hallucinations. 

First, the method of murder is described as ""biting his neighbour's head"" in the summary, which contradicts the source text that states Luigi Costa allegedly stomped on Terrence Freebody'amo's head and cut his throat. This is an intrinsic hallucination because it directly contradicts information from the source text (Sentences: ""Luigi Costa...is accused of stomping on his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody's head, cutting his throat"").

Second, the summary states that Luigi Costa allegedly killed his neighbor in 2012. However, according to the source text, it is not clear whether he was actually convicted or if this is still an ongoing case (""a jury has heard"" implies a trial). This can be considered as a factual hallucination because while it might be verifiable by world knowledge (if one were to look up court records), it cannot be inferred from the source text.

16,"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","the deep reddish color caught seattle native tim durkan 's eye . he photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on cnn ireport . the stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of siberia . the fires were started in southeastern siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields .",,0,0,0,0,0,"The argument in favor of [HALLUCINATED]:

1. ""Kevin Pietersen takes a moment to reflect ahead of a team photo shoot for Surrey."" - The source text states, ""The event at the KIA Oval comes before the start of the County Championship season,"" which implies that there is a team photo shoot happening. Additionally, it mentions, ""Pietersen looks ahead in deep thought,"" indicating he's reflecting during this time.

2. ""Pietersen looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo."" - The source text directly states, ""Pietersnk looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo,"" which confirms that Pietersen was indeed reflecting during the team photo.

3. ""The batsman joked with photographers at the KIA Oval for the photo session."" - The source text mentions, ""Pietersen joked with photographers at the Kia Oval for the photo session,"" which supports this statement in the summary.

4. ""Surrey set to begin their campaign at Glamorgan on April 19."" - The source text states, ""Surrey play Oxford MCCU in a MCC University match on Sunday"" and mentions that Surrey's County Championship season begins with a game against Glamorgan on April 19.

The summary contains a factual hallucination. 

1. The statement ""Pietersen looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo"" is misleading because while it mentions he was in deep thought, it does not clarify that he was also in a jovial mood, which is an important aspect of his demeanor during the photo session. The source text states, ""Pietersen looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo, but was otherwise in a jovial mood,"" indicating that the summary omits crucial context about his overall emotional state.

2. The summary does not include the context of Downton's dismissal paving the way for Pietersen's potential return to the England team, which is a significant point made in the source text. This omission leads to a lack of understanding of the implications of the photo session and Pietersen's mindset.

20,"Esteban Cambiasso has won all the major European competitions a player can during his illustrious career but revealed that keeping Leicester City in the Premier League would be up there with the best. The Foxes are currently seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, with only eight games remaining, knowing that time is running out to save themselves. Cambiasso refuses to give up and admits that keeping Leicester up will feel like winning a trophy. Esteban Cambiasso says that helping keep Leicester in the Premier League will feel like winning a trophy 'For me, it's like another cup,' he told BBC East Midlands Today. 'When you start another season you have an objective, and this is the objective for us. 'For me, winning a cup or winning the league with another team is the same now as having the possibility to save Leicester in the Premier League.' The Argentinian midfielder poses with the trophy after his team won the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup Cambiasso had an illustrious career at Inter Milan, winning an impressive 15 trophies during his stint River Plate (2001-2002) Argentine Primera Division Real Madrid (2002-2004) La Liga Super Cup Supercopa de Espana Inter Milan (2004-2014) Champions League Serie A (5) Coppa Italia (4) Supercoppa (4) FIFA Club World Cup Having not won a game since January, Nigel Pearson's men face West Ham United on Saturday and Cambiasso is still convinced they can avoid the drop. 'I understood when I signed for Leicester it's not an easy job to stay in the Premier League,' he said. 'It's a difficult situation but I think we have our chances to win matches. There's a quarter of the Premier League left to finish. 'I think some people think for Leicester all is finished. But I'm sure, because I watch my team-mates every day, we can save Leicester and stay in the Premier League.' The former Inter Milan star signed for the Foxes in the summer, leaving Italy after ten years and embarking on a new challenge in England. After agreeing to a one-year-deal, Cambiasso has quickly established himself as a key player but it remains to be seen if he'll still be in the East Midlands at the start of next season. The former Real Madrid man was also successful during his short spell in Spain for Real Madrid Cambiasso played during Real's 'Galatico' era, with Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham 'Leicester always wanted me,' he added. 'After these nine months or eight months, I'm very happy because my family is OK, and I'm good. 'I want a few more points, but all the rest is perfect.'

Secondly, the summary claims that Roma beat their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Inter Milan. This contradicts the source text, which mentions that Roma's last home win was against Inter Milan on November 30 and that they won against Napoli in this match to end their winless streak.
