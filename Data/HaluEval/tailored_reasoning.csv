17,"London (CNN)Congolese immigrant Tarsis Mboma Thale has a small business selling T-shirts in Johannesburg, South Africa. Thale's job normally requires him to walk the streets of the city he has called home for the past few years. But at the moment, he says, this is not an option. Because he is simply too afraid. The reason is a wave of anti-immigrant violence that has swept the country in recent days, leaving several dead as authorities scrambled to detain those responsible and prevent further bloodshed. The cause of this surge in violence is murky, with some blaming alleged inflammatory comments about foreign nationals from the Zulu king, local media reported, others saying a labor dispute between locals and foreigners back in March turned nasty. Unemployment in impoverished areas has also been a factor. The violence has caused thousands of immigrants to seek refuge at police stations and shelters. Thale fears he'll be attacked if he goes to work. ""I'm scared to go to town because I do not know when these people can attack and it's stressful for me,"" he told CNN. ""We're close to month end -- how am I going to pay the rent and feed my wife?"" CNN spoke to several immigrants living and working in South Africa about the crisis, which has caused South African President Jacob Zuma to postpone an overseas visit and left authorities scrambling to prevent further clashes. On Tuesday the country's Defense Minister said South Africa would deploy troops to areas where police spread too thin in order to halt the attacks. Zimbabwe immigrant Stanley Ndlovu says he is so frightened he dare not venture outside, not even to go to the local mall. He works in Johannesburg as a cleaner and gardener, and also runs a small tuck shop where workers can buy food and basic supplies at his place of work. It's a role he hears many South Africans say should belong to them alone. He feels the South African government has been far too slow to respond to the violence, which has erupted intermittently in various cities over the past few years. ""To stop violence they need to arrest and sentence the perpetrators,"" he says. Meanwhile, Eric Kalonji left the Democratic Republic of Congo and arrived in the South African capital in 2012, working as a waiter until the restaurant he worked at closed in January. Now devoting himself to his studies in New Zealand, he feels that the situation in South Africa is more complex than a simple case of ""us versus them."" He believes the blame lies heavily on what he calls the government's failure to provide its people with jobs and education. ""This xenophobia thing is the result of a deeper malaise (in) South Africans"" he says. ""A better policy from the government should be empowering the people with wider access to education so that they will qualify for the jobs that they say they deserve."" OPINION: Labeling South Africa turmoil 'xenophobia' scapegoats poor blacks. Kodwo Amissah Benyi, a hotel receptionist originally from Ghana, now lives in the town of Louis Trichardt in South Africa's Limpopo province. He's far from the worst of the violence, but still close enough to follow the news with alarm. ""I fear it may spread because I don't know what may spark unrest,"" he said. However he praised the government's response to the attacks. ""The government is in crisis mode and Pretoria (the South African government) is responding well by verbally condemning the attacks and showing force on the ground,"" he said.

",,0,1,0,"To determine if the statement ""One man expressed his concerns in the form of a question"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the highlighted sentence and the context provided in the document.

1. The highlighted sentence is: ""How am I going to pay the rent and feed my wife?"" says one man.
2. This sentence is a direct quote from Tarsis Mboma Thale, who is expressing his concerns about his financial situation due to the fear of going to work amidst the violence.
3. The statement we are analyzing claims that ""One man expressed his concerns in the form of a question."" 

Now, let's break it down:
- The highlighted sentence is indeed a question.
- It is expressed by one man (Tarsis Mboma Thale).
- The content of the question reflects his concerns about paying rent and feeding his wife, which aligns with the statement.

Since the statement accurately describes what is happening in the highlighted sentence and is directly supported by the document, we conclude that the statement is [SUPPORTED]."

",,South Africa is on the brink of collapse because of a surge in anti-immigrant violence led by the Zulu king's inflammatory comments targeting immigrants. Immigrants are fleeing in droves leaving the government in crisis mode.,1,1,1,"To determine whether the statement ""South Africa is on the brink of collapse"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document and the summary.

1. The document discusses a wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa, which has caused fear among immigrants and led to thousands seeking refuge at police stations and shelters. 
2. It mentions that the violence has left several dead and that authorities are scrambling to prevent further bloodshed. 
3. The document also highlights the response of the South African government, including the deployment of troops to areas affected by violence.
4. However, the document does not explicitly state that South Africa is on the brink of collapse. It describes a serious situation but does not use the term ""collapse"" or suggest that the country is at that level of crisis.
5. The summary states that South Africa is on the brink of collapse due to the violence, but this is a conclusion drawn from the events described rather than a direct statement from the document.

Given this analysis, the statement ""South Africa is on the brink of collapse"" cannot be directly and explicitly inferred from the document. Therefore, it is not supported.

53,"The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents.

The British Army fired approximately 10,000 rounds from their SA-80 assault rifles during Afghan conflict. Each of the 5.56mm rounds, pictured, used in the SA-80 assault rifle costs approximately 50p. Each round cost approximately 50p. A further two million 9mm rounds were fired from handguns. According to a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror, at least 80,000, 105mm artillery shells - at a cost of £1,250 each - were fired at Taliban positions. Soldiers went through an estimated £5,000 worth of ammunition for the their assault rifles every day during the eight-year conflict. A further 55,000, 30mm rounds were fired from Apache gunships. Each of these rounds costs about £65, but are able to go through solid concrete and can destroy a Taliban vehicle in seconds. The helicopters are able to provide vital close air support for ground troops pinned down by the opposition. SAS veteran Robert Henry Craft told the Mirror: 'The amount of ammo expended shows how British troops in Afghanistan were fighting for their lives every day. 'That so many 9mm rounds were used shows how close the fighting was at times'. The conflict claimed 453 UK lives.

Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation but midway through the first half, Liverpool adjusted their shape to 4-4-1-1, pushing Coutinho wide left and allowing Gerrard to adopt a more central position behind the striker.

Gerrard controls possession under pressure from Villa's Ashley Westwood at Wembley. Gerrard almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line. POSSESSION. The first half largely passed Gerrard by as playing further forward starved him of any sustained spells of possession and Villa crowded out the space in front of their back four to good effect. Dropping back into central midfield after the interval allowed the Liverpool captain to collect the ball from his defenders but his passing was cautious and occasionally wayward.

69,"Tax adviser Duncan Hodgetts (pictured), from Birmingham, West Midlands, fell to his death from a Manhattan building. A British tax advisor has plunged more than 100ft to his death from an apartment window in a suspected suicide while on a business trip to New York. Duncan Hodgetts, 25, fell from the 14th floor window of the Executive Plaza building in midtown Manhattan at 8.30am yesterday morning. He was found on a third-floor balcony of the neighboring Michelangelo Hotel, near the Rockefeller Center, and was pronounced dead at the scene. It is understood the tax specialist for Ernst and Young, based in Birmingham, had been on a business trip when he fell from the balcony of one of the corporate apartments. An NYPD spokesman said  they were treating his death as suicide. He said: 'Officers were called at about 8.29am to the Michelangelo Hotel to reports a man had jumped to his death. 'His body was found on the third floor balcony of the hotel and he was pronounced deceased at the scene. 'Detectives from the mid-district precinct contacted his family and we are not treating the incident as suspicious. 'It is being treated as suicide and there are no further investigations into the matter at this stage.' A doorman at a nearby hotel confirmed to MailOnline that a body was removed from the apartment building at 11am on Monday. In a statement Ernst and Young said: 'We are very saddened to hear of the death of our colleague, Duncan Hodgetts. The 25-year-old reportedly fell from a 14th floor apartment window at the Executive Plaza building (pictured) at 8.30am on Monday. A spokesman for the New York Police Department said they were treating Mr Hodgetts' death as suicide.

'The matter is being investigated by the New York Police Department and they can expect our full cooperation. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Duncan's family, friends and colleagues.'

69,"Tax adviser Duncan Hodgetts (pictured), from Birmingham, West Midlands, fell to his death from a Manhattan building. A British tax advisor has plunged more than 100ft to his death from an apartment window in a suspected suicide while on a business trip to New York. Duncan Hodgetts, 25, fell from the 14th floor window of the Executive Plaza building in midtown Manhattan at 8.30am yesterday morning. He was found on a third-floor balcony of the neighboring Michelangelo Hotel, near the Rockefeller Center, and was pronounced dead at the scene. It is understood the tax specialist for Ernst and Young, based in Birmingham, had been on a business trip when he fell from the balcony of one of the corporate apartments. An NYPD spokesman said  they were treating his death as suicide. He said: 'Officers were called at about 8.29am to the Michelangelo Hotel to reports a man had jumped to his death. 'His body was found on the third floor balcony of the hotel and he was pronounced deceased at the scene. 'Detectives from the mid-district precinct contacted his family and we are not treating the incident as suspicious. 'It is being treated as suicide and there are no further investigations into the matter at this stage.' A doorman at a nearby hotel confirmed to MailOnline that a body was removed from the apartment building at 11am on Monday. In a statement Ernst and Young said: 'We are very saddened to hear of the death of our colleague, Duncan Hodgetts.

90,"A husband convicted of beating his wife to death after she filed for divorce has been sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity. The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence. James Robarge (above pictured in court last month), 45, of Vermont was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. Robarge was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge. The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this. Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News. In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.' One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom. 'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday. During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge. And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years. Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.
","James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning. He was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge. Robarge has already served two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years.

2. The summary states, ""He has been sentenced to life in prison, but could be eligible for parole in just 28 years."" This suggests that while he has received a life sentence, there is a possibility of parole after 28 years.

Wayne Rooney, Sir Stanley Matthews, Duncan Edwards and Peter Shilton are all veterans of the long-contested Under 16 tournament between the different associations within the United Kingdom. England are the most successful team in the history of the Victory Shield, but it has been announced that they will not be fielding a side in the competition.

It is understood the decision has been sped up by Sky Sports' move to withdraw funding and propose an altered format, with Gareth Southgate, the FA's head of national teams at St George's Park, saying player development is the key reason. 'We are reviewing our fixture programme at all ages and it is important that with England we are able to give players an international experience that compliments their club development and attempts to expose them to something different,' he said. 'At Under 16 level we may only have the boys for between 10 to 15 matches per season. Within that programme, it's important to prioritise exposing them to European and world opposition. 'We feel that within their club programmes, they face many of the boys that they would face in the Victory Shield and so these fixtures, whilst competitive and exciting, do not expose our boys to different playing cultures.

141,"Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. Although he too was touted as a ""perfect"" candidate who was the ideal person for the job, something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail. He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling. Gore had trouble connecting with voters, and he seemed to remake his image constantly. His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee, rather than what he actually stood for. Clinton must avoid following Gore's path. She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and can't afford to do so again. She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience. That is not enough. More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House. Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents, even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change. A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability. After the announcement, they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity. In his first day on the campaign trail, Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted. That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. Their greatest virtue, their immense skills as politicians, has often come back to haunt them. Bill Clinton was attacked as ""slick Willie"" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism. When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq, many Democrats didn't buy her critique of President George W. Bush's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead. When she conducted her ""listening tour"" of New York before running for the Senate, many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider. When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email, some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn't always telling us what she was really about. Even if she isn't hiding anything, she often gives that appearance. During the next few months, Clinton will also have to connect with her party's base. The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton's candidacy. While they will probably vote for her, they are not very motivated and don't trust that she will stand for Democratic values. She will need to address these concerns, not through her style but through her agenda. Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing. She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran. Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large. Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance, for instance -- that won't be aimed at male candidates. Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism. But the struggle will be tough. Finally, and this relates to the last challenge, Clinton will have to contend with her husband. To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail, one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation. But he can also be liability. As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control. When he speaks his mind, as he did in dismissive comments about Obama's candidacy, it can often work against her. The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest, and ongoing stories about his personal life, as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago, could re-emerge on the campaign trail. Whether that is fair or not is beside the point: Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail. Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate. But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months.

1. The highlighted sentence states that ""Clinton also needs to convince voters of her authenticity, Zelizer says."" This indicates that the assertion about Clinton needing to convince voters of her authenticity is attributed to Julian Zelizer.

2. In the document, there is a mention of Julian Zelizer discussing Hillary Clinton's need to connect with her party's base and to address concerns about her authenticity. This aligns with the highlighted sentence.

141,"Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency.

",,Hillary Clinton's candidacy for the 2016 presidential election has been met with doubts about her ability to connect with voters and her authenticity. Her husband's personal life could also be a liability for her campaign.,1,0,1,"To determine whether the statement ""Hillary Clinton ran for the 2016 presidential election"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document step-by-step.

1. The document explicitly states that ""Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election."" This indicates that she is in the process of running for the election.

2. The summary reflects this by stating that ""Hillary Clinton's candidacy for the 2016 presidential election has been met with doubts about her ability to connect with voters and her authenticity."" This confirms that she is indeed a candidate for the election.

3. The highlighted sentence reiterates the same point about her candidacy and the associated doubts.

4. The statement in question asserts that ""Hillary Clinton ran for the 2016 presidential election."" The use of ""ran"" implies that she has already completed the action of running, while the document discusses her candidacy as an ongoing process.

Given that the document discusses her candidacy but does not confirm that she has completed the act of running (as the election has not yet occurred), the statement is not fully supported by the document. It is more accurate to say she is in the process of running rather than stating she ran.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

1. The document states that the population of Asian elephants has decreased significantly over the last century, from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000. This indicates a massive decline in the population, not an increase.

2.

Instead, it discusses the conservation efforts and the decline in the population due to poaching and habitat destruction.

3. The highlighted sentence in the summary incorrectly states that the decision to stop using elephants in shows is due to a ""massive increase"" in their population, which contradicts the information provided in the document.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not supported by the document, as it misrepresents the situation regarding the population of the elephants.

Iona Costello, 51 (right) and her 14-year-old daughter Emily (left) have been missing for almost three weeks after last being seen on March 30 near their home in the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. The pair often go to shows and museums in New York City, but relatives have filed a missing person report after Emily did not return to her East Hampton school from Spring Break. Relatives of the family, who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork, reported them missing on Tuesday. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. Iona Costello also has family in England, though they have not heard from her, according to Southold Local. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not.

1. The document states that Iona Costello and her daughter Emily are from Greenport, not Greenpoint. This is a crucial distinction because Greenport and Greenpoint are two different places in New York.

2. The summary incorrectly refers to Greenport as ""Greenpoint,"" which is a misrepresentation of the location.

1. The document mentions that police do not expect foul play and have no hard evidence suggesting that the Costellos may be in danger. This indicates that while there is concern for the missing individuals, the police do not have evidence to support the idea of an abduction.

2. The summary states that ""Police are investigating a possible abduction but say there is no hard evidence to suggest the family is in danger."" This implies that the police are considering the possibility of abduction as part of their investigation.

3. However, the document itself does not explicitly state that the police are investigating a possible abduction. Instead, it emphasizes that there is no evidence of foul play or danger.

Based on this analysis, the statement ""Police are investigating a possible abduction"" is not directly supported by the document, as the document does not confirm that abduction is being actively investigated. Therefore, the statement is considered to be hallucinated.

219,"A 12-year-old Israeli girl is missing after a tour boat she was on exploded and caught fire off Thailand's southwestern coast on its way to Phuket. The youngster was thought to have been in the toilet on board the Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry which was carrying more than 100 people, including many foreign tourists, when the incident happened at around 3.30pm local time. Passengers were throwing themselves into the Andaman Sea after the engine exploded and flames ripped through the boat, according to the Bangkok Post. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. The Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry burns after the engine exploded in the Andaman Sea in Krabi province. A 12-year-old Israeli girl who was reportedly in the toilet at the time is still thought to be missing. Thick black smoke can be seen rising from the stricken vessel. Between 100 and 110 passengers and crew had to be rescued by a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft. The Associated Press reported that the 12-year-old girl may have been picked up by another boat that was going to the beach resort of Phuket. But Police Captain Sutthiwat Aunsiam, a duty officer at Muang Krabi station, told Jor Sor 100 radio late in the evening that rescue units are still searching for the girl and Krabi Governor Songpol Sawasditham confirmed her disappearance, according to Thai Rath Online. Most of the passengers and crew, totalling between 100 and 110, were taken back to Ao Nang near the resort town of Krabi from where the Ao Nang Princess 5 originally set off. About a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft from police and marine authorities assisted in the rescue operation. More rescue staff and divers, including personnel from Third Naval Area Command, will join the search for the missing girl tomorrow. None of those brought ashore were reported to be injured, but one person aboard the boat did die, according to Phuket News. Pol Capt Sutthiwat quoted Wirat Jittaraporn, the captain of the 35-metre long, 4.5-metre wide ferry, as saying the vessel was about five miles from Railay beach near Ao Nang when he heard an explosion from the engine room. He immediately ordered everyone to don life jackets and prepare to abandon ship. The fire quickly engulfed the ferry and burned it to the waterline before it sank at around 6pm off Krabi's Noppharat Thara beach. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. Passenger Panupon Rattanakornpanya, 44, told Thai Rath Online, that crew members told him and his wife and child that a fire had broken out and ordered everyone to gather at the bow. 'The fire then grew stronger. Everyone was in a panic. Some were crying. Many grabbed jackets and passed them on to others before we jumped into the water,' he said.

",,0,0,1,"To determine whether the statement ""No injuries reported."" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the document.

1. The document states: ""None of those brought ashore were reported to be injured, but one person aboard the boat did die, according to Phuket News."" 
2. This indicates that while most passengers and crew were not reported injured, there was one fatality.

Now, let's evaluate the statement:
- The statement claims ""No injuries reported."" This is misleading because it does not account for the fact that there was one death reported, which implies that not everyone was uninjured.

Given this analysis, the statement does not accurately reflect the information in the document, as it omits the detail about the fatality.

Conclusion: The statement is not supported by the document because it fails to acknowledge the death of one person aboard the boat.

219,"A 12-year-old Israeli girl is missing after a tour boat she was on exploded and caught fire off Thailand's southwestern coast on its way to Phuket. The youngster was thought to have been in the toilet on board the Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry which was carrying more than 100 people, including many foreign tourists, when the incident happened at around 3.30pm local time. Passengers were throwing themselves into the Andaman Sea after the engine exploded and flames ripped through the boat, according to the Bangkok Post. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. The Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry burns after the engine exploded in the Andaman Sea in Krabi province. A 12-year-old Israeli girl who was reportedly in the toilet at the time is still thought to be missing. Thick black smoke can be seen rising from the stricken vessel. Between 100 and 110 passengers and crew had to be rescued by a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft. The Associated Press reported that the 12-year-old girl may have been picked up by another boat that was going to the beach resort of Phuket. But Police Captain Sutthiwat Aunsiam, a duty officer at Muang Krabi station, told Jor Sor 100 radio late in the evening that rescue units are still searching for the girl and Krabi Governor Songpol Sawasditham confirmed her disappearance, according to Thai Rath Online. Most of the passengers and crew, totalling between 100 and 110, were taken back to Ao Nang near the resort town of Krabi from where the Ao Nang Princess 5 originally set off. About a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft from police and marine authorities assisted in the rescue operation. More rescue staff and divers, including personnel from Third Naval Area Command, will join the search for the missing girl tomorrow. None of those brought ashore were reported to be injured, but one person aboard the boat did die, according to Phuket News. Pol Capt Sutthiwat quoted Wirat Jittaraporn, the captain of the 35-metre long, 4.5-metre wide ferry, as saying the vessel was about five miles from Railay beach near Ao Nang when he heard an explosion from the engine room. He immediately ordered everyone to don life jackets and prepare to abandon ship. The fire quickly engulfed the ferry and burned it to the waterline before it sank at around 6pm off Krabi's Noppharat Thara beach. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. Passenger Panupon Rattanakornpanya, 44, told Thai Rath Online, that crew members told him and his wife and child that a fire had broken out and ordered everyone to gather at the bow. 'The fire then grew stronger. Everyone was in a panic. Some were crying. Many grabbed jackets and passed them on to others before we jumped into the water,' he said. Governor Songpol said the ferry was equipped with fire extinguishers, 'but in this case it appeared [the crew] were not able to control the blaze and this must be investigated again'. The governor went to Ao Nang, a popular hopping off point for Phi Phi, Phuket, Koh Lanta and other islands, as passengers from the sunken vessel milled on the shore.

However, the 12-year-old Israeli girl is still being searched for.",1,1,1,"To analyze the statement ""The Israeli girl died in the Andaman Sea,"" we need to refer back to the document provided.

1. The document states that a 12-year-old Israeli girl is missing after a tour boat she was on exploded and caught fire. It mentions that she was thought to have been in the toilet at the time of the incident.
2. The document does not confirm that the girl died; it only states that she is still thought to be missing and that rescue operations are ongoing.
3. The summary incorrectly states that the girl died as a result of the boat explosion, which is not supported by the document. The document only indicates that one person aboard the boat did die, but it does not specify that it was the Israeli girl.

Based on this analysis, the statement ""The Israeli girl died in the Andaman Sea"" is not supported by the document, as it explicitly states that she is still missing and does not confirm her death.

1. The document describes Maria Twomey's journey of weight loss, detailing her lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. It mentions that she swapped unhealthy foods for healthier options and engaged in intense workouts, including weight lifting and using an exercise bike.

2. The document does not mention any surgical procedures or weight loss surgery. Instead, it emphasizes her commitment to personal training and lifestyle changes as the means through which she achieved her weight loss.

3. The summary incorrectly states that she underwent ""major weight loss surgery,"" which is not supported by the document. The document clearly attributes her transformation to her efforts in fitness and diet rather than any surgical intervention.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not supported by the document. Therefore, the conclusion is:

233,"Reptile: The 6ft-long albino northern pine snake was found curled up on top of a bath mat on a radiator. A teenage girl was shocked to discover a huge albino snake curled up on top of the radiator in her bathroom. Hannah Brierley, 16, thought her mother was playing a prank when she spotted the six foot-long northern pine snake on a bath mat which was hung up to dry at her home in Rochdale, Manchester. She stared at the reptile for a few minutes until it moved and quickly called for her 40-year-old mother, Karen Marriott, to come upstairs. Mrs Marriott attempted to call the RSCPA at 7am yesterday morning but after she was unable to get through she panicked and dialled 999. She said: 'Hannah was calm at first. She can't even deal with spiders, but I don't think she thought it was real. 'She'd been looking at it for a few minutes until it moved. She thought I was having a joke. 'I felt like a wally dialling 999 but I didn't know what to do. I'm frightened because I don't know how it got in. 'It was like something out of a film. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Everybody needed a wee, but we couldn't go.' Craig Wallace, a detective based at Rochdale police station, overheard the control room call and although it's not a police matter, he offered to help as he has experience with keeping snakes. Det Con Wallace used a pillowcase to capture the white snake and took it back to the station, before being transferred into the care of the RSPCA. The officer added: 'I keep snakes so I know a lot about them. It was a northern pine snake. They can give a nasty bite, but they're not venomous. 'If it did bite you, you would struggle to get it off. I put my hand through a pillow slip then got the back of it's head and wrapped it up.'

A regular pine snake, of which the northern pine is a subspecies, in the wild. They vary in colouring. The northern pine snake, or pituophis melanoleucus - a subspecies of the common pine snake - are endemic to south eastern states in the United States, including Alabama and Kentucky. In the wild, colours can vary from to deep-brick to a wine red. Captive varieties tend to be amelanistic or 'albino', which are descendants of a specimen hatched from a wild-collected clutch of eggs. The find occurred near the eastern edge of the Pine Barrens in Ocean County, New Jersey, in the early to mid-1980s. They generally prefer to live in areas with pine flatwoods, sandy pine-oak woodlands or cultivated fields. Pine snakes are carnivorous animals and mainly feed on mice, rats, moles and other small animals. Captive-bred specimens docile behaviour makes them perfect pets and their voracious appetite and rapid growth are some of the reasons for their popularity. Most hatchlings, which are around 12 to 16 inches, will feed immediately and though they may strike and hiss at first, with frequent handling they usually calm down. Adults, which grow between 4ft and 6ft, can be more difficult to calm down if the animal was not handled frequently as a hatchling or juvenile.

3. The document mentions that Det Con Craig Wallace believes the snake may have entered through an open door or window during the warm weather. This supports the idea that there is a belief about the snake's entry point, but it does not confirm that it specifically came in through a window alone.

4. Since the statement only refers to a window and does not acknowledge the possibility of a door, it does not fully align with the information provided in the document.

",,0,0,0,"To determine if the statement ""One elephant turned violent"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document step-by-step.

1. The document describes a situation where a herd of elephants invaded a village in India, and one of the elephants became violent.
2. It specifically mentions that locals were trying to coax the elephants back into the forest when one of them suddenly became violent.
3. The highlighted sentence from the summary also states that ""Locals were trying to coax elephants into the forest when one turned violent,"" which aligns with the information in the document.

Since the document explicitly states that one elephant turned violent while the locals were attempting to coax the herd back into the forest, we can conclude that the statement is directly supported by the document.

Therefore, the analysis leads to the conclusion that the statement is [SUPPORTED]."

Elephants invaded a village in India and one turned violent as people tried to coax them back into the forest. Attack: Ramiul Sheikh, 50, was violently knocked to the ground after desperately trying to outrun the animal. Damage: The herd  invaded the village in the Murshidabad district of the country, destroying crops and houses. Mr Ramiul said: 'I didn't realise how dangerously close I was to the elephant. 'Before I knew what was happening it came charging right at me. Not once but twice. 'It was only by the grace of God that I managed to escape.'

",,"A man in India was surprisingly attacked twice by a five-ton elephant after he attempted to coax it back into the forest with other residents. The elephant eventually retreated and the man, Ramiul Sheikh, walked away uninjured.",1,1,1,"To determine whether the statement ""The man, Ramiul Sheikh, walked away uninjured"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document carefully.

1. The document describes an incident where Ramiul Sheikh was charged at by an elephant. It mentions that he was knocked to the ground and that he narrowly escaped being crushed to death.
2. It states that after the encounter, Ramiul walked away ""miraculously unharmed,"" but it also notes that he was ""visibly shaken and covered from head to toe in mud.""
3. The term ""unharmed"" can be interpreted as not suffering any serious injuries, but the phrase ""visibly shaken"" suggests that he experienced a significant emotional or psychological impact from the event.

Given this analysis, while Ramiul Sheikh did not sustain physical injuries that would be classified as serious, the document does not explicitly state that he walked away ""uninjured"" in the sense of being completely unaffected. The emotional and psychological effects of the encounter are implied but not detailed.

Therefore, the statement ""The man, Ramiul Sheikh, walked away uninjured"" is not fully supported by the document due to the nuances of his experience.

2.

",,Republican presidential hopefuls Christie and Rubio have taken a hard stance against marijuana legalization and plan to crack down on pot in states where it has been legalized.

Both candidates also promised to beat Hillary Clinton if they run for presidency.,1,0,1,"To analyze the statement ""Both candidates are running for presidency,"" we need to refer back to the document and the summary provided.

1. The document mentions that Chris Christie and Marco Rubio are both presidential hopefuls, indicating that they are candidates for the presidency. 
2. The summary reiterates that both candidates have taken a hard stance against marijuana legalization and also mentions their promise to beat Hillary Clinton if they run for presidency.

Now, let's evaluate the statement in question:

- The statement claims that ""Both candidates are running for presidency."" 
- While the document and summary indicate that they are presidential hopefuls, it does not explicitly state that they are currently running for the presidency. The term ""hopeful"" suggests they are candidates but does not confirm that they are actively running at this moment.

Given this analysis, the statement is not directly supported by the document, as it does not confirm that both candidates are actively running for the presidency, only that they are hopefuls.

303,"Hillary Clinton  'whooped' for joy at the birth of her granddaughter before she saw Bill becoming tearful in the hospital waiting room, she has revealed. The former Secretary of State gave details of her daughter's pregnancy in a new Epilogue for her memoir, Hard Choices, released just days before she is expected to announce her presidential run. In the new chapter, shared by the Huffington Post on Friday, she suggested that the birth of her granddaughter made her think about the future of all children and had motivated her political plans. She explained how in 2014, she and her husband got the 'wonderful news' that their daughter Chelsea and her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky were expecting a baby. Doting: Hillary Clinton, pictured with her husband Bill and their granddaughter Charlotte after her birth last year, has said the baby girl has made her realize she has much more work to do. Hillary Clinton was 'unabashedly giddy' at the news, she said. 'As the summer slipped away, I drove Chelsea crazy checking in practically every hour,' she wrote. 'How are you feeling? Any news from the doctor? When's it going to happen!' But, whereas she and Bill had been disorganized ahead of the birth of Chelsea, their daughter was far calmer and better prepared, she wrote. 'I remember how frazzled [Bill] was when it was finally time to go to the hospital,' she recalled of her own labor. 'Lamaze recommended bringing a small plastic bag of ice to suck on during labor. Bill ended up bringing enough to fill a thirty-nine-gallon garbage bag. It was quite a sight. 'By comparison, Chelsea and Marc were much more organized and prepared.' In September, Chelsea started going into labor in New York City, so they headed to the hospital to greet their first grandchild - Charlotte Clinton Mezvinksy, who was born on September 26. 'Chelsea emerged, exhausted but glowing,' she wrote. 'All our pent up nervous energy burst out in laughter and excited whoops, more like a couple of kids than the newly-minted grandparents we had suddenly become. 'After a while, Bill and I stepped out into the hallway to let them rest. We sat quietly, holding hands, trying to process the rush of emotions. I looked over and saw a tear in Bill's eye.' Calm: In a new chapter of her book, Hillary Clinton said her daughter Chelsea and son-in-law Marc Mezvinksy were far more organized and relaxed about the birth of baby Charlotte than she was about Chelsea. Proud: She revealed that she saw tears in her husband's eyes after the birth of baby Charlotte at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, pictured, last September. She is the couple's first granddaughter. She explained that while she had been nervous about giving birth to Chelsea and the impending responsibility, 'as a new grandmother... there is nothing but joy'. 'It's probably the world's best job,' she wrote. 'I love every minute of it.' She added that even though she has a terrible singing voice - so terrible that an 18-month-old Chelsea told her to stop singing to her - she enjoys singing lullabies to baby Charlotte. 'Charlotte has yet to complain,' she wrote. Welcoming her granddaughter has made her want to make the world a better place for Charlotte and other children, she wrote in the epilogue - hinting that she will be back in politics soon. 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on,' she wrote. 'Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.' Nervous: She said that before the birth of Chelsea, pictured together in the 1980s, she had been so nervous about being a mother but that now she finds being a grandmother is pure joy. She went on: 'In just a few months, Charlotte had already helped me see the world in new ways. There was so much more to do.' Earlier this week, former President Bill Clinton said his granddaughter has changed his outlook in politics too - although it's had the opposite effect. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody,' he told Town & Country magazine. 'I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' It followed reports that Hillary has rented space for her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. According to reports on Friday, she will announce her bid to run for president on Sunday before immediately traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with voters.
","In the new chapter released on Friday, Clinton shared her experiences as a grandmother and how they had motivated her political plans. She recalled how disorganized she had been before the birth of Chelsea, whereas Chelsea had been so composed before becoming a mother. The Clintons 'whooped' with delight when Charlotte was born last September and Hillary noticed Bill becoming emotional. While she had been nervous about being a mother, being a grandmother is 'pure joy' - and has made her think about all children's futures, she said. She is expected to announce her run for president on Sunday.

Nervous: She said that before the birth of Chelsea, pictured together in the 1980s, she had been so nervous about being a mother but that now she finds being a grandmother is pure joy. She went on: 'In just a few months, Charlotte had already helped me see the world in new ways. There was so much more to do.' Earlier this week, former President Bill Clinton said his granddaughter has changed his outlook in politics too - although it's had the opposite effect. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody,' he told Town & Country magazine. 'I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' It followed reports that Hillary has rented space for her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. According to reports on Friday, she will announce her bid to run for president on Sunday before immediately traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with voters.
",,"Hillary Clinton has announced her bid for the presidency after the birth of her granddaughter Charlotte made her realize she has much more work to do. She and her husband had been disorganized ahead of the birth of Chelsea, but Chelsea and Marc were much more organized and prepared. The Clintons were exhilarated with the news of Charlotte's birth in September, with Hillary whooping with delight and Bill becoming emotional. Being a grandmother is 'pure joy' and has made her want to make the world a better place for Charlotte and other children, she wrote in the epilogue. She will be starting her campaign on Sunday.",1,1,1,"To determine if the statement ""Bill Clinton became emotional upon hearing the news"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the document and the summary.

1. The document describes a scene where Hillary Clinton recounts the birth of her granddaughter Charlotte. It mentions that after the birth, ""I looked over and saw a tear in Bill's eye,"" indicating that Bill Clinton was emotional at that moment.

2. The highlighted sentence from the summary states that ""the Clintons were exhilarated with the news of Charlotte's birth in September, with Hillary whooping with delight and Bill becoming emotional."" This aligns with the document's description of Bill's emotional reaction.

3. However, the statement in question specifically refers to Bill Clinton becoming emotional ""upon hearing the news."" The document does not explicitly state that Bill became emotional at the moment he heard the news of the birth; it describes his emotional reaction after the birth when he saw his granddaughter.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not directly supported by the document because it misrepresents the timing of Bill Clinton's emotional response. Therefore, the conclusion is:

But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team. Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name.

'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off.

A protester who caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions has walked free from court. Steven Abberley, 28, hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year. He then threw the glass balls from the public gallery, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen. Abberley excused himself to fellow observers before shouting 'you are all just liars' at Prime Minister David Cameron and the rest of the chamber during the televised Parliamentary debate. When arrested, Abberley told police officers that he had daubed the words 'the enemy within' in red paint on the palace's walls, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told. Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon said the incident happened five minutes before the end of the weekly question-and-answer session. She said: 'Without warning at 12.25pm, Mr Abberley stood up and began to shout, ""I'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen"". 'Mr Abberley's arms were outstretched, he said: ""you f***ing w*****s, you are just liars"".' Abberley, who is unemployed, then interjected from the dock, telling the court: 'Can I just say for the record I didn't call anyone ""f***ing w*****s"". I called them ""dishonourable b******s"".' Ms Ramkissoon continued: 'He produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen, causing a loud bang.' The prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen, but the marbles scattered causing 'distress and shock' to the people in the gallery. 'When he was arrested, Abberley made admissions to the arresting officer concerning criminal damage to the Palace of Westminster', she said.

","Steven Abberley threw marbles during PMQs but they hit a security screen. He stood up and shouted 'you are all just liars' before the bizarre attack. Abberley, 28, also spray painted graffiti on a wall outside the public gallery. He was given suspended sentences for threatening behaviour and criminal damage.
",,0,1,1,"To determine whether the statement ""He stood up and shouted 'you are all just liars'"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document step-by-step.

1. The document describes an incident involving Steven Abberley during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).
2. It states that Abberley ""stood up and began to shout, 'I'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen'"" and then proceeded to shout ""you f***ing w*****s, you are just liars"" at the politicians.
3. The document also mentions that Abberley later clarified in court that he actually called them ""dishonourable b******s"" instead of the expletive he initially used.
4. The highlighted sentence in the summary states that ""He stood up and shouted 'you are all just liars' before the bizarre attack.""
5. The statement we are analyzing is ""He stood up and shouted 'you are all just liars'.""

Now, we compare the statement to the document:

- The document does confirm that Abberley stood up and shouted at the politicians, but it specifically quotes him as saying ""you f***ing w*****s, you are just liars"" rather than the exact phrase ""you are all just liars.""
- The phrase ""you are all just liars"" is a paraphrase or a variation of what he actually shouted, which introduces a discrepancy.

Since the statement does not match the exact words used in the document and is a variation of what was reported, it cannot be directly and explicitly inferred from the document.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is not supported by the document.

Final conclusion: [HALLUCINATED]"
349,"Steven Abberley caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions. A protester who caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions has walked free from court. Steven Abberley, 28, hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year. He then threw the glass balls from the public gallery, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen. Abberley excused himself to fellow observers before shouting 'you are all just liars' at Prime Minister David Cameron and the rest of the chamber during the televised Parliamentary debate. When arrested, Abberley told police officers that he had daubed the words 'the enemy within' in red paint on the palace's walls, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told. Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon said the incident happened five minutes before the end of the weekly question-and-answer session. She said: 'Without warning at 12.25pm, Mr Abberley stood up and began to shout, ""I'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen"". 'Mr Abberley's arms were outstretched, he said: ""you f***ing w*****s, you are just liars"".' Abberley, who is unemployed, then interjected from the dock, telling the court: 'Can I just say for the record I didn't call anyone ""f***ing w*****s"". I called them ""dishonourable b******s"".' Ms Ramkissoon continued: 'He produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen, causing a loud bang.' The prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen, but the marbles scattered causing 'distress and shock' to the people in the gallery. 'When he was arrested, Abberley made admissions to the arresting officer concerning criminal damage to the Palace of Westminster', she said.

",,"Steven Abberley was sentenced to prison after he threw marbles at MPs and shouted 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions. He also caused damage to the Palace of Westminster, which cost more than £2,000 to remove. However, Abberley's sentence was suspended due to his good behavior.",1,1,1,"To determine whether the statement ""The suspension of Abberley's sentence was due to his good behavior"" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document carefully.

1. The document states that Steven Abberley was sentenced to eight weeks in prison for throwing marbles and four weeks for graffiti, but both sentences were suspended.
2. The judge mentioned that Abberley's personal views of politicians are a matter for him, but the way he chose to express them (through criminal damage and antics) was problematic.
3. The document does not explicitly state that the suspension of his sentence was due to ""good behavior."" Instead, it focuses on the nature of his actions and the judge's comments about the disruption caused.
4. The summary mentions ""good behavior,"" but it does not provide a direct link between this behavior and the suspension of the sentence in the document.

Given that the document does not explicitly support the idea that the suspension was due to good behavior, but rather discusses the nature of his actions and the judge's comments, we can conclude that the statement is not directly supported by the document.

Therefore, the statement is [HALLUCINATED]."
350,"The Tories are set to steal Labour’s thunder by unveiling tax breaks for workers on the minimum wage. A text message intended for a senior aide to George Osborne – but accidentally sent to a newspaper – yesterday divulged plans for a ‘tax free minimum wage’. The details are unclear, but it is thought this would mean that those on the minimum wage would be exempt from paying any income tax – even if its level is raised in future. New plan: The details of George Osborne's leaked plans are unclear, but it is believed to mean that minimum wage earners wouldn' t be paying any income tax. The minimum wage currently stands at £6.50 an hour, rising to £6.70 in October. Labour’s Ed Miliband yesterday pledged that he would help low earners by raising the level above £8 an hour by October 2019. But the Conservatives look set to outflank both Labour and the Lib Dems on the issue of low pay with a firm commitment in their own manifesto, released today. David Cameron said in his speech to the Conservative party conference last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax – currently £10,600 – go up to £12,500 by April 2020. This will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether, while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth £500 a year. Critique: Danny Alexander said Osborne’s spending plans are 'becoming less and less credible' But if Mr Cameron goes further by also raising the minimum wage – and still keeping everyone on it out of tax – then that would represent a major giveaway. Tax cuts for the low paid are a priority for the Prime Minister after promising to raise the inheritance tax threshold and the 40p rate of tax for those on higher incomes. A text message from Downing Street intended for the Chancellor’s adviser, Neil O’ Brien, read: ‘Hi Neil, Have sent you the tax free min wage press notice draft. Rupert asks if you could print for George in no11?’ Rupert refers to Rupert Harrison, the Chancellor’s most senior economic adviser. The text message ended up being sent to a journalist at The Guardian. It is thought that it refers to a guarantee that, every time the minimum wage rises, its recipients would be protected from paying any income tax. Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said it would be another unfunded spending commitment. He added:‘George Osborne’s spending plans are becoming less and less credible by the day, and it’s embarrassing. ‘They now expect the public to believe them when they make unfunded promises with one hand, whilst decimating family budgets and public services with the other.’ Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour party, said: ‘The Tories are making panicky promises with absolutely no idea how they will pay for them.’ Mr Miliband yesterday brought forward by one year his pledge to increase the minimum wage to £8. He also promised to enforce it more effectively with higher fines for offending firms.

",,0,0,0,"To determine whether the statement ""Follows Ed Miliband's pledge to raise the minimum wage to £8."" is supported by the document, we need to analyze the content of the document step-by-step.

1. The document discusses a leaked text message revealing plans for a 'tax free minimum wage' by the Tories, which would exempt minimum wage earners from paying income tax.
2. It mentions Ed Miliband's pledge to raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour by October 2019.
3. The summary states that the plans for the 'tax free minimum wage' by Osborne ""follows"" Miliband's pledge, indicating a chronological or causal relationship between the two events.

The document explicitly states that Miliband has made a pledge to raise the minimum wage, and the summary reflects this by stating that the plans for the tax-free minimum wage come after Miliband's pledge.

1. The document discusses a leaked plan regarding a ""tax free minimum wage"" which suggests that minimum wage earners would be exempt from paying any income tax. However, it does not explicitly state that income tax will be completely abolished for all minimum wage earners.

2. The document mentions that the details are unclear and that it is believed that minimum wage earners wouldn't be paying any income tax, but it does not confirm a complete abolition of income tax.

3. The summary states that the UK government is set to ""completely abolish income tax for all minimum wage earners,"" which is a stronger claim than what is supported by the document. The document implies a potential exemption from income tax but does not confirm a complete abolition.

4. The highlighted sentence in the summary reflects this stronger claim, which is not directly supported by the document's content.

Based on this analysis, the statement is not directly and explicitly supported by the document. Therefore, it is considered to be a hallucination.
