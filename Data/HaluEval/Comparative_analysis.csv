1,"Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world. Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United. Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters. Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final. He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's £86million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday. The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes. The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey. The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season. He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas. De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea. De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for £18million. All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.
","Gareth Bale has been linked with a summer move to Manchester United. The Wales forward has been criticised by Real Madrid fans this season. United want Bale but he has no desire to cut short his time in Spain. A swap deal involving United keeper David de Gea has been mooted. Real are interested in bringing De Gea to Spain to replace Iker Casillas.

2,"Satellite TV operator DirecTV has pulled the plug on its popular advertising campaign featuring 80s heartthrob Rob Lowe after complaints by rival Comcast. The cable company complained to the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division (NAD) that the ads featured a number of false claims and the watchdog has ruled that several of the campaign's claims couldn't be substantiated. The series of ads, which launched last October, featured the 50-year-old actor playing two characters: a handsome Lowe in a slick suit who is always the DirecTV customer and then an 'odd or awkward alter-ego' who was a cable user. Scroll down for video. Satellite TV operator DirecTV is ending its advertising campaign featuring 80s heartthrob Rob Lowe after complaints by rival Comcast that their claims couldn't be substantiated. The ads all ended with Lowe saying: 'Don't be like this me — Get rid of cable and upgrade to DirecTV.' The NAD report highlighted a number of inaccurate claims concerning signal reliability, shorter  customer service wait times, better picture and sound quality and a better sports package. Other issues included the 'superiority message' of Lowe's closing phrase, as well as DirecTV's 'rated No. 1 claim' and another that stated that it has been 'ranked higher than cable for over 10 years.' The NAD also recommended that DirecTV 'either discontinue the price claim featured in the ""Scrawny Arms Rob Lowe"" commercial or modify it to reflect the price of a package that included the sports programming featured in the commercial.' 'While humor can be an effective and creative way for advertisers to highlight the differences between their products and their competitor's, humor and hyperbole do not relieve an advertiser of the obligation to support messages that their advertisements might reasonably convey — especially if the advertising disparages a competitor's product,' the NAD said on Tuesday. A National Advertising Division report highlighted a series of inaccuracies concerning signal reliability, shorter customer service wait times, better picture and sound quality. 'Given the absence in the record of supporting evidence, NAD recommended the advertiser discontinue the claims.' DirecTV has said it disagrees with NAD's findings with respect to its ranking claims, picture quality claims and sports programming claims and that it plans to appeal. The operator is discontinuing the Lowe-fronted ads, but claims that 'it was always scheduled to end at the end of Q1'. 'We wanted to launch our new campaign with Hannah Davis in the Final Four [NCAA basketball championship],  Jon Gieselman, SVP, Marketing at DirecTV told TheWrap. 'We always reserve the right to bring back the Rob Lowe campaign, either in its current form or with new spots, it has been extremely successful for the brand.' The company had previously argued that its advertisements were 'so outlandish and exaggerated that no reasonable consumer would believe that the statements being made by the alter-ego characters are comparative or need to be substantiated.'

3,"The last thing many people would expect to discover when delving into their gran's past, is their successful career as a pin-up girl. Helen Dunn, 78, wasn't ever expecting to relive her daring past, but was surprised when she opened a copy of the Sunday Mercury newspaper to find a photo of herself starring back. The mother-of-two and grandmother, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was flicking through the newspaper when she spotted herself on the cover of a raunchy lads' mag from 1955. Helen Dunn, 78, was shocked to discover her cover images for vintage lads mag Span, when she opened the Sunday Mercury newspaper. Vintage beauty: The grandma, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was only 17 years old at the time of the cover shoot. The cover was featured as a part of collector Tim Beddow's 'antiques rudeshow' collection of 700 vintage men's mags, the Birmingham Mail reports. And there Dunn was - under her model pseudonym, Sherry Morris - on the cover of top-shelf British magazine, Span. The cover image shows Dunn, who was just 17 years old at the time, perched seductively on a stool with her legs slightly crossed. Naughty or nice: Helen made all her own costumes for the raunchy shoot for Span, including the fur muff (pictured right) 'I was always outgoing' - Helen didn't mind the risqué nature of the shoot, in which she posed seductively for the camera. The 78-year-old wears an off-the-shoulder top, and her stockings and suspenders are in full display. In an interview with the Birmingham Mail, the glamorous gran admitted that she was shocked to see the images. She said: 'When I saw the picture I was absolutely shocked. 'I shouted, 'That's me! I think it's great, I have no secrets.' Back in the day, Dunn had a brief stint as a model, before she went on to marry a professional footballer three years later: Manchester United's Alan Dunn. Dunn (pictured right) went on to marry Manchester United footballer Alan Dunn (left), just three years after the cover shoot. The grandmother recalls her modelling days with a fondness, and remembers the shoot clearly. Helen had even made her own outfit, including the fur muff. She had posed in the garden of local photographer Royston Campbell after a friend of Helen sent him images. 'He was a gentleman, a very nice man,' she recalls. 'Nothing iffy about him at all. 'I always made my own outfits, even the umbrellas. The picture was originally for a Christmas calendar. 'Back in the day, I wasn't bad looking and didn't have a bad figure' - Helen looks back on her modelling days. 'I suppose the magazine was looked on as a little risqué, but it really didn't bother me. I didn't think about it. I was always outgoing. When breaking the news to her two grown-up children, Helen had no worries about how her former career would be perceived. She admitted: 'You know what? They think it's great.' 'Back in the day, I wasn't bad looking and didn't have a bad figure.'

Saturday's event -- dubbed ""the royal wedding of Scotland"" -- took place at Dunblane Cathedral, with cheering crowds spilling onto the streets to support their home-grown talent. The grand slam and Olympic champion donned a traditional blue and green tartan kilt, while his bride dazzled in a vintage-style gown by British designer Jenny Packham. The people of Dunblane braved wind, rain and even snow to catch a glimpse of the happy couple, having seen Murray grow from a young boy into a British sporting legend. ""Absolutely fabulous to see them today, especially Andy coming back to his hometown,"" said one lady in the crowd. ""He's a hero. He's done something that all local boys would really strive to do. He's a superstar,"" added another. The couple met at the U.S. Open in 2005 and got engaged in November last year. Before the ceremony, and understandably lost for words, Murray resorted to a series of emoticons to sum up his excitement for the day. Fellow tennis veteran Rafael Nadal and First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon posted their congratulatory messages on Twitter. But any plans for a honeymoon have been put on hold as the world number three returns to tournament action next week.

A semi-professional footballer has been sacked by Clitheroe FC after he was filmed having sex with a supporter in the manager's dugout while wearing a club tracksuit. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. The 73rd minute substitute for the Lancashire non-league side was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside, on Saturday afternoon, was shared on social media. His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' The footballer  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' Mr Hart and his girlfriend could not be reached for comment. No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' Mr Hart and his girlfriend could not be reached for comment. No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.
",,"Jay Hart, 24, has been sacked by Clitheroe FC after being caught having sex with a supporter who was wearing the club's tracksuit. Hart could be heard on the mobile footage laughing as he was filmed romping with the woman, who has yet to be identified. The footage was widely circulated on Twitter and Instagram. Following the incident, Hart's girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, took to Clitheroe Football Club's Facebook page to express her disgust. Despite the uproar, Hart and the unidentified woman determined to reveal themselves to the public, have gained a great deal of popularity online, being dubbed the ""Hottest Football Couple of the Year.""",1,1,1,1,1,1,1

9,"We're always hearing about the latest 'superfoods' - and how they could have a powerful effect on our health and wellbeing. And while the term 'superfood' might be thrown around a little too freely sometimes, there are some fruits and seeds that really are a power-house of nutritional value. Here, I reveal which ones are worth adding to your shopping basket today... Scroll down for video. Sour cherries contain high levels of antioxidants and as a result are anti-inflammatory, can help a person sleep and can improve recovery after a sports injury, Dr Sally Norton said. TART CHERRIES. What are the benefits? Tart or sour cherries  have been found to contain high levels of antioxidants. As a result the benefits  include anti-inflammation, boosted sleep, and improved sports recovery. Reports have suggested that an increased intake of tart cherries could help to reduce certain post-workout side-effects, such as muscle aches, inflammation and weakness. AVOCADO. What are the benefits? More than just the main ingredient in guacamole, avocados seem to be having a real moment in the spotlight, and it's not surprising. They're a great source of healthy, mono-saturated fats – which have been known to help lower bad cholesterol, and as a result, reduce our risk of heart attack and stroke. In fact, a recent study has suggested that combining a moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day could actually lower your levels of bad cholesterol by more than a low-fat, or moderate-fat diet without avocados. Avocados are a great source of healthy, mono-saturated fats, which have been shown to lower bad cholesterol and reduce a person's risk of heart attack or stroke. CRANBERRIES. What are the benefits? As many of you will know, cranberries have been used for years as an aid against urinary tract infections. But studies have suggested these berries could also have a wide range of other benefits – from improving our heart health, helping to prevent certain cancers, to boosting our oral health and helping to reduce infections. What helps to make them just so good for us are the polyphenols that are present in those little red berries. Polyphenols have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, to name just a few. Just be careful where you get your cranberry intake from, as cranberry juice and juice drinks are often full of sugar. Polyphenols found in cranberries are reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Studies have shown they can improve heart health and help prevent certain cancers. BLUEBERRIES. What are the benefits? With their high levels of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, blueberries have been linked to all kinds of health benefits, including heart health, cancer prevention, enhanced brain function and improved eyesight. And if that's not enough, some studies have suggested that the antioxidants in blueberries could help to delay the ageing process – a much cheaper alternative to all those anti-ageing creams. PUMPKIN SEEDS. What are the benefits? We all know how nutritious pumpkins are, but there's even more to be said for the pumpkin seed. It provides great levels of protein, fibre, manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous, and is a rich source of zinc - important for immunity, cell growth and division, as well as sleep, mood, and eye and skin health. It's not surprising it's been dubbed a 'superseed'. A handful of these little seeds make a great, nutrient-packed snack, or add them to your porridge for a tasty nutrient boost. Blueberries, left, have been linked to a wide range of health benefits including improved heart health, cancer prevention and improved eyesight. And pumpkin seeds, right, dubbed 'superseeds', are thought to help a person sleep, improve their mood and boost eyesight. CHIA SEEDS. What are the benefits? Seed du jour, the chia seed has seen a steep rise in popularity over the past couple of years - unsurprising, given its high levels of nutrients and low-calorie intake. Loaded with antioxidants, soluble fibre and minerals, chia seeds are also a source of omega-3 - though not as easily used by our bodies as that obtained from fish - and contain more calcium, ounce for ounce, than milk. If you're after a easy way to add chia seeds into your diet, try out our simple, creamy chia porridge recipe. Sprinkle the seeds on to porridge that has been mixed with low-calorie, but vitamin-rich rice milk, and you’ve got yourself a healthy, creamy, nutrient-packed breakfast.

Sterling will be hoping to help Liverpool to a crucial Premier League victory against Newcastle United on Monday evening as Brendan Rodgers' side look to close the gap to fourth-place Manchester City. Sterling made his Liverpool debut in a Premier League defeat against Wigan in 2012. Sterling (second right) models Liverpool's new kit alongside (l-r) Adam Lallana, Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho last week as the new strip was revealed. The former Queens Park Rangers youngster also revealed how a visit to Anfield as a starstruck 15-year-old convinced him that a career on Merseyside was the right move. He added: 'I was 15 when I signed to Liverpool’s youth team, and I have to admit I was starstruck. The first time I saw Stevie [Gerrard] I thought he was a fake! I couldn’t believe he was real and not a waxwork. 'By the time I was 14, I had trials lined up at Arsenal, Chelsea and Fulham, but my Liverpool trial at Anfield came first, and when I saw the stadium and the training ground, I thought: “Right, I’m not leaving here until I’ve signed.' Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping Sterling decides to stay at Anfield next season.
",,"Raheem Sterling has agreed to a new contract offer from Liverpool after stating that he has no desire to leave the club. He claims to have dreamed of playing for the Reds ever since he was a young boy and has no intention of leaving anytime soon. Sterling is looking forward to playing alongside fellow Liverpool stars Gerrard, Coutinho and Henderson for many years to come.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1
12,"Football in Turkey has been suspended for one week following the armed attack on Fenerbahce's team bus on Saturday. Meanwhile, a Turkish official says police have detained two people suspected of involvement in the attack. Trabzon Governor Abdil Celil Oz said the two suspects were detained early on Tuesday and that one of them is believed to have followed the convoy while the other fired shots with a rifle at the bus. The decision to suspend football in Turkey affects both next weekend's Super Lig fixtures and the midweek cup quarter-finals, although Besiktas' match against Istanbul Basaksehir, the last of this weekend's Super Lig matches, is scheduled to go ahead on Monday evening. Fenerbahce's bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor, which Fener won 5-1, in Turkey's Super Lig. Five round marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attack. The window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday night. The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attack. Fenerbahce on Sunday demanded that football be suspended until the incident was dealt with and the perpetrators punished, and on Monday a one-week suspension was announced by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) following a meeting with sports minister Akif Cagatay Kilic. 'This was a cowardly and treacherous attack,' Kilic said in comments on the TFF website. He added: 'I think it's important to make this response. This was an attack not just on Fenerbahce, but an attack on Turkish sport and Turkish football. I believe we will stand as one against it.' Kilic also wished a speedy recovery to the bus driver, named as Ufuk Kiran, who was injured in the attack. The club had posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen. The pictures also showed blood on the driver's seat and the steering wheel. The attack followed Fener's 5-1 win away to Rizespor. The bus was going over a viaduct on its way from the city of Rize to the airport in Trabzon to return to Istanbul when the incident occurred. Fenerbahce had temporarily gone top of the league with Saturday's win, although Galatasaray returned to the summit on Sunday by beating Karabukspor 4-2, and they sit two points clear with eight matches remaining. Ashen-faced head coach Ismail Kartal surveys the damage to the team bus. Players and coaching staff survey the damage after the attack near the city of Trabzon.

13,"With 20 goals to his name this season, Watford captain Troy Deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the Premier League. In fact, Deeney has been lighting up the Championship for the last three seasons, scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game. The next logical step for the Birmingham-born striker is the top flight and, with Watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go, he could well be skippering the Hornets in the Premier League next season. Watford striker Troy Deeney won the Championship's Player of the Month award for March. Hornets skipper Deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading Watford to the Premier League. Deeney believes he can follow in the path of Charlie Austin and Danny Ings  by becoming a Premier League hit. Watford are currently just one point behind Championship leaders Bournemouth with five games left to play. And Deeney, who was this week named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level. He said: 'I've looked at Charlie Austin, Danny Ings, Rickie Lambert and Grant Holt before that. 'These are all people that have been in the Championship, done well, then held their own in the Premier League. 'There is a sign there that you can really go on (from the Championship). If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.' It seems fair for Deeney to say 'when' and not 'if' he plays at the top level because on this season's evidence he and striker partner Odion Ighalo certainly are ready for it. Between them the Championship's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and Deeney waxed lyrical about his Nigerian strike partner. 'He's a natural finisher,' he said. 'Before Saturday (when Ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over Middlesbrough) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18-yard box. 'He's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles, one game he got four. He scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker.' Deeney is adamant that together he and Ighalo could terrorise Premier League defences. 'I've been and watched a few games this season and I don't see why not,' he said. Watford striker Odion Ighalo has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign. Deeney has been impressed with Slavisa Jokanovic since the Watford manager took charge in October. 'I think you have to be very ruthless in the Premier League and we've shown that we can score goals. 'Are we confident we can do it? Definitely.' Watford - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion-chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss Slavisa Jokanovic took charge in October. But referring to that period Deeney, who has played under seven managers since joining Watford from Walsall in 2010, insists: 'It wasn't that bad.' He added: 'It definitely brought the players closer together. 'It's just one of those things really, in any line of work if your manager changes your job doesn't change.' Watford have won 15 of Jokanovic's 27 matches in charge and Deeney has been impressed by the Serbian's tactical flexibility. Ahead of Saturday's trip to Millwall, he said: 'We've got a talented squad so we can go from 4-4-2 to 4-4-2 diamond to 3-5-2 or 4-3-3. 'His (Jokanovic's) adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out.' Former Watford boss Beppe Sannino handed Deeney the captain's armband during his brief spell in charge. But Deeney's role in the revival of Watford's season, not just as goalscorer but as captain, cannot be underestimated. Beppe Sannino made him captain before the start of the season and Deeney seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water. 'I was very vocal anyway,' he said. 'If I've got something to say I'm going to say it anyway, good or bad, and I think that once people know me they respect that. 'If you're doing good I'll tell you you're doing good, if you're doing wrong I'll tell you you're doing wrong. I don't expect anything else of others towards myself. 'The added responsibility of now having to lead even more by example, I think that's the only that's changed. 'But then I think I did it pretty well beforehand, I think that's why they made me captain. They know what I'm about and what I offer. 'But now it's a case of justifying why they have made that decision.' Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release. Deeney has warned his Watford team-mates they have 'three weeks of hard work' ahead of them. 'The two are definitely linked,' he admits. 'But it's more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity I had, instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by. 'I've just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it, so it (prison) was probably a blessing in disguise.' Captaining Watford in the Premier League next season, Deeney admits, would be the crowning glory after three years' hard work following his release. 'That would be the fairytale ending,' said the 26-year-old. 'But we've got three weeks of hard work before we can even start thinking about that, so I'm just going to keep working and hopefully that fairytale can come true.' You get the feeling Deeney will be playing in the Premier League regardless of what happens in the next few weeks. But  Watford have as good a chance as any of promotion with their talismanic captain in the side.
","Watford striker Troy Deeney is yet to play in the Premier League. Deeney is regarded as one of the best strikers outside the top-flight. He has scored 64 goals in 123 games during his last three seasons. The Hornets are currently just one point behind leaders Bournemouth.

14,"Britain will still be running a budget deficit at the end of the decade despite plans to return the country to the black, the International Monetary Fund warned last night. The global watchdog said the state will continue to spend more on public services and other areas such as welfare and overseas aid than it raises in tax throughout the next parliament. The projection underlines just how hard it will be for the next government to eliminate the country’s annual deficit, which hit a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 and now stands at £90billion. The International Monetary Fund (managing director, Christine Lagarde, pictured) warned Britain will still be running a budget deficit at the end of the decade, despite plans to return the country to the black. The Conservatives have pledged to return Britain to the black in 2018-19 with a surplus of £5.2billion – the first since 2001. David Cameron and George Osborne then plan to run a surplus of £7billion in 2019-20. But the IMF predicted that there will still be a deficit of £7billion that year – even after a decade of austerity. The warning, in the Fund’s Fiscal Monitor report into government finances around the world, will alarm the Tories in particular as they attempt to persuade voters that only they can balance the books. But it also raises the prospect of even higher borrowing under a Labour government. The report warned that ‘uncertainties pertaining to the May elections’ mean spending may not be cut as fast as planned. The Conservatives have pledged to return Britain to the black in 2018-19 with a surplus of £5.2billion – the first since 2001. Ed Miliband is already planning a slower pace of deficit reduction than the Tories with experts warning he could be borrowing around £30billion a year by the end of the decade. But that figure is likely to be even higher if the IMF is proved right and tax receipts do not live up to current expectations. Vitor Gaspar, director of fiscal affairs at the IMF, said it was crucial for all countries to get their public finances under control. He said governments ‘should build buffers in good times’ – echoing Mr Osborne’s pledge to ‘fix the roof while the sun is shining’. Speaking at the launch of the Fiscal Monitor in Washington, Mr Gaspar said: ‘Countries that fail to build buffers in good times often find themselves without fiscal space to manage a crisis and that is very costly.’ The bleak projections for the UK public finances come despite the IMF hailing ‘solid’ economic growth in the UK. It is now expecting growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next year – making Britain the second fastest growing economy in Group of Seven industrialised nations behind the United States.

15,"The handsome Italian maths teacher who has taken the internet by storm for being the perfect mix of beauty and brains has spoken out about his new-found fame. Pietro Boselli, 26, originally from Brescia, Italy, says that he originally tried to keep his modelling a secret from his colleagues at the University College London (UCL) where he taught for fear they might 'look down on him'. In an interview with the Times, Boselli, an advanced maths lecturer with a PHD, said that when he was trying to establish himself as a teacher, he didn't want to include his work for fashion companies such as Abercrombie and Fitch on his CV and was less than proud of his alternative career. Scroll down for video. Not your average teacher: Wearing a tiny pair of green shorts, 26-year-old advanced maths teacher Pietro Boselli admits he tried to keep his double life as a model a secret from colleagues and students at UCL. The Italian model, whose looks have seen him amass a following of nearly half a million users on Instagram, isn't afraid to whip off his shirt to show his hard-earned muscles, pictured above with 'lifelong friend' Carmelo. More than just a pretty face: The lecturer has now achieved his PHD and is hoping to earn enough money from modelling to set up his own engineering consultancy. He told the newspaper he didn't want students in his classroom or his teaching peers to know, saying: 'I think, in a way, I was ashamed. I thought people in academia would look down on me.' Growing up in Italy, the young Boselli was scouted by Armani Junior which started off a double life of studying hard for his exams and posing in front of the lens whenever he could. He calls himself a 'nerd' and says that his studies were his priority growing up, forcing him to turn down lucrative jobs that would take him away from his books. His students at UCL, where he taught while studying for his PHD, did eventually discover the fitness fanatic's secret, after Googling him. When one maths student, Arief Azli, discovered his 6ft 1in lecturer's Instagram account, which has now amassed more than 480,000 followers, and has plenty of images of him in varying states of undress, he tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model.' Azil posted a picture of his lecturer scribbling equations on the whiteboard next to one of him shirtless with the caption: 'Only at UCL‬ ‪#‎MechanicalEngineers‬ ‪#‎ModellingandAnalysis ‪#‎Bromance‬.' Other students soon followed suit and posted pictures of him taking classes, with one saying: 'This is why I never miss a class'. Boselli says he knew his students had cottoned on when they started to take 'sneaky' images of him while he was at the front of the lecture hall. Cycling in the sea? He must be clever! Pietro says he trains once or twice a day to keep fit and is proud to show of his amazing body. A gruelling exercise regime keeps the model in tip-top condition: Pietro posted this image of a recent rock-climbing expedition on his Instagram account. Huge following: Pietro, pictured centre right with friends on a recent trip to Brooklyn, has now finished his stint as an advanced maths teacher at UCL (right) to concentrate on being a full-time model. Now the secret's out, the model, who has signed for top agency Models 1, says he's not worried about them seeing him posing topless. 'People ask me ""why are you topless in pictures? Why don’t you have any clothes on?"" But training is a big part of my life. 'I started going to the gym when I moved to London and, like everything I do, I’m very focused. I train once or twice a day and I’m happy to get recognition for having a good physique.' Boselli has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and is hoping that the money he earns from modelling will help him to establish his own engineering company in London. And the bad news for all those currently brushing up on their algebra? He's got a girlfriend. Although the model won't be drawn on her identity and there is little sign of her on his Instagram account, he has confirmed that he is off the market. The fashion model posted this picture on his Instagram account with a caption 'post-workout selfie' He describes himself as 'addicted to training' and said he works out at least two or three times a day. One of his students, Arief Azli tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model' Pietro's academic achievements are easily as impressive as his six-pack. He was awarded the Undergraduate Faculty Excellence Scholarship for the most outstanding academic achievement in his first year at UCL, before going on to get first-class honours. The fashion model was discovered at the age of six by renowned designer Giorgio Armani who saw potential and said he should be a model. His Instagram account gives an insight into his fitness regime as he posted a picture of himself in the pool, saying: 'Boosts circulation, gets metabolism up to speed and strengthens immune system!' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency'. In an interview with F Tape he said he would be concentrating on 'engineering, teaching maths and personal training' if he was not modelling. He posted a picture of his washboard abs on his Instagram, saying: 'Lying in bed.. My point of view' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency' He also revealed that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oscar Wilde and The Rolling Stones were among his idols. Hundreds of fans have taken to social media to say they would have concentrated slightly harder in lessons if Mr Boselli had been their teacher. Rachel Ruane said: 'Would trade my maths teacher for him in a heartbeat oh my god #PietroBoselli #teachmealgebraanyday.' Cassy Chavez said: 'I would never miss a class too!' Aly Dos Equis said: 'Good thing this guy wasn't my math teacher I'd have a hard time paying attention.' Pieter Botha ‏said: 'No fair! I never had a math teacher like you? I would've passed.' He won first prize in the tall fitness model category at the WBFF European pro-am fashion event.

The Italian model, whose looks have seen him amass a following of nearly half a million users on Instagram, isn't afraid to whip off his shirt to show his hard-earned muscles, pictured above with 'lifelong friend' Carmelo. More than just a pretty face: The lecturer has now achieved his PHD and is hoping to earn enough money from modelling to set up his own engineering consultancy. He told the newspaper he didn't want students in his classroom or his teaching peers to know, saying: 'I think, in a way, I was ashamed. I thought people in academia would look down on me.' Growing up in Italy, the young Boselli was scouted by Armani Junior which started off a double life of studying hard for his exams and posing in front of the lens whenever he could. He calls himself a 'nerd' and says that his studies were his priority growing up, forcing him to turn down lucrative jobs that would take him away from his books. His students at UCL, where he taught while studying for his PHD, did eventually discover the fitness fanatic's secret, after Googling him. When one maths student, Arief Azli, discovered his 6ft 1in lecturer's Instagram account, which has now amassed more than 480,000 followers, and has plenty of images of him in varying states of undress, he tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model.' Azil posted a picture of his lecturer scribbling equations on the whiteboard next to one of him shirtless with the caption: 'Only at UCL‬ ‪#‎MechanicalEngineers‬ ‪#‎ModellingandAnalysis ‪#‎Bromance‬.' Other students soon followed suit and posted pictures of him taking classes, with one saying: 'This is why I never miss a class'. Boselli says he knew his students had cottoned on when they started to take 'sneaky' images of him while he was at the front of the lecture hall. Cycling in the sea? He must be clever! Pietro says he trains once or twice a day to keep fit and is proud to show of his amazing body. A gruelling exercise regime keeps the model in tip-top condition: Pietro posted this image of a recent rock-climbing expedition on his Instagram account. Huge following: Pietro, pictured centre right with friends on a recent trip to Brooklyn, has now finished his stint as an advanced maths teacher at UCL (right) to concentrate on being a full-time model. Now the secret's out, the model, who has signed for top agency Models 1, says he's not worried about them seeing him posing topless. 'People ask me ""why are you topless in pictures? Why don’t you have any clothes on?"" But training is a big part of my life. 'I started going to the gym when I moved to London and, like everything I do, I’m very focused. I train once or twice a day and I’m happy to get recognition for having a good physique.' Boselli has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and is hoping that the money he earns from modelling will help him to establish his own engineering company in London. And the bad news for all those currently brushing up on their algebra? He's got a girlfriend. Although the model won't be drawn on her identity and there is little sign of her on his Instagram account, he has confirmed that he is off the market. The fashion model posted this picture on his Instagram account with a caption 'post-workout selfie' He describes himself as 'addicted to training' and said he works out at least two or three times a day. One of his students, Arief Azli tweeted: 'That moment when you realise your maths lecturer is a top designer model' Pietro's academic achievements are easily as impressive as his six-pack. He was awarded the Undergraduate Faculty Excellence Scholarship for the most outstanding academic achievement in his first year at UCL, before going on to get first-class honours. The fashion model was discovered at the age of six by renowned designer Giorgio Armani who saw potential and said he should be a model. His Instagram account gives an insight into his fitness regime as he posted a picture of himself in the pool, saying: 'Boosts circulation, gets metabolism up to speed and strengthens immune system!' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency'. In an interview with F Tape he said he would be concentrating on 'engineering, teaching maths and personal training' if he was not modelling. He posted a picture of his washboard abs on his Instagram, saying: 'Lying in bed.. My point of view' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency' He also revealed that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oscar Wilde and The Rolling Stones were among his idols. Hundreds of fans have taken to social media to say they would have concentrated slightly harder in lessons if Mr Boselli had been their teacher. Rachel Ruane said: 'Would trade my maths teacher for him in a heartbeat oh my god #PietroBoselli #teachmealgebraanyday.' Cassy Chavez said: 'I would never miss a class too!' Aly Dos Equis said: 'Good thing this guy wasn't my math teacher I'd have a hard time paying attention.' Pieter Botha ‏said: 'No fair! I never had a math teacher like you? I would've passed.' He won first prize in the tall fitness model category at the WBFF European pro-am fashion event. His Instagram account gives an insight into his fitness regime as he posted a picture of himself in the pool, saying: 'Boosts circulation, gets metabolism up to speed and strengthens immune system!'

16,"Glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend Richie Benaud, after his death at 84 from skin cancer. At Lord’s, MCC flags were lowered, and the Australian government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a Test series as his country’s captain, then became a commentator. David Cameron said he had ‘grown up listening to Richie Benaud’s wonderful cricket commentary’, while his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott called it ‘a sad day for Australia’. Retiring as a player in 1964, Benaud’s masterful analysis was universally revered. Here, we reproduce a tribute paid by the Mail’s brilliant sports columnist IAN WOOLDRIDGE — which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in England switched from terrestrial to satellite TV, depriving cricket fans of Benaud’s voice . . . Richie Benaud in the commentary box at the Oval for the final test of the 2005 Ashes. Thereafter international cricket fans in England lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite TV. So it is farewell, then, to the Master of Measured Words. Richie Benaud will not be returning to England next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket’s finest commentator. That is not merely my judgment. A recent poll by The Wisden Cricketer magazine attracted an astonishing 12,000 votes. Precisely 10,128 of them nominated Benaud as the best. Fortunately, he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success, particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of Tower of Babel verbiage. He does so in a valedictory book which is an encyclopaedia of broadcasting wisdom. He names no names. He is too polite for that. Nor is there a hint of the tetchiness that occasionally afflicts icons in their pensionable years. At 74, Benaud is still as fit as a flea, the result of a lifestyle as measured as his commentating. Yes, there are rare occasions when he will let down his hair with the rest of us, but when serious business is afoot he will rise from an increasingly raucous dinner party, check his watch that it is exactly 10pm and announce: ‘Thank you very much. We’re off.’ At sunrise next morning, he and Daphne, his elegant and unfailingly supportive English wife, will be striding out on their three-mile constitutional. Benaud representing Australia in 1961. He led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. He is meticulous in all things. On TV commentary days, even Daphne is not allowed to iron his shirts. He presses them himself. He is a food faddist, preparing his Test match lunch boxes at home to be certain of what he is eating. Once, he took a week-long course in Italy to learn how to cook pasta to perfection. His desks at his homes in London, South of France and Sydney are polished plateaux of precision, his reference-book shelves indexed for instant reach. It is this unrelenting self-discipline, instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother — there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with Richie and his Test cricketer brother John in the book — that launched him into his dual career life. The first, of course, was in cricket, where to haul oneself from school, to club, to State, the Australian team and then its captaincy was a classic climb. Benaud led his country in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. Such was his cunning as a wrist-spinner that his batsmanship was often overlooked. In fact, he became the first, in an era when far fewer Tests were played, to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs. But what next? All of seven years before he retired from cricket, Benaud wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry. There was little doubt about that since he had been a young crime reporter on a Sydney newspaper, where sub-editors ruthlessly deleted from his copy any flowery phrases which he thought rather good but were irrelevant to the story. It was an important lesson. Then a curious opportunity, which couldn’t happen in today’s schedules, presented itself. At the end of Australia’s 1956 tour to England, all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the British Isles. Australian captain Richie Benaud takes on the MCC in the first innings at Brisbane on December 5, 1958. Benaud proceeded otherwise. At his own expense he moved from the Kensington Palace Hotel into a cramped lower ground room in the RAC club in Pall Mall and took a BBC television training course, alongside directors, commentators, even audiences, to learn how television worked. He trailed Peter O’Sullevan at Newbury and he studied the commentating techniques of Henry Longhurst on golf and Dan Maskell on tennis. All three had their idiosyncrasies, but one thing they had in common. O’Sullevan, voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race, was circumspect about collateral chatter, just as Longhurst and ‘Oh I say’ Maskell knew the value of golden silence. Indeed, one of Longhurst’s silences was so long that his director asked over the private intercom: ‘Excuse me, Henry, but are you still alive?’ Benaud now says: ‘I didn’t know if I had a future in broadcasting. If I hadn’t done that BBC course my life would have been very different, even though I had to wait for seven years for my chance. ‘The key feature it taught me was the economy of words. Never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves. Only add to it if you had something pertinent to say.’ Benaud rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between England and Australia at Lord's during the 2009 Ashes. These days if only. Has he ever made a bloomer? Of course, like all of us, he has. On one celebrated occasion, handing over from a Test match for a news update from Moira Stuart, he called her Moira Shearer, the celebrated ballerina who had starred in an acclaimed film. When Moira Stuart handed back he said: ‘Thanks, Moira, our newsreader wearing Red Shoes.’ Many, who had not heard his initial blunder, wondered what on earth he was on about. ‘At the time,’ he recalls, ‘I thought it was a pretty clever remark, but many tuning in at that moment had no idea what it meant. It taught me never to be such a smart-arse again.’ Laconic, economic, massively instructive and with a dry impartial wit about whoever is getting the upper hand in a Test match, I wonder if we shall ever hear his like again on television? Many are called and surprisingly many are given the opportunity behind the microphone. Very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator.

18,"Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared. Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean. Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, ""I saw this strange plane"". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre. The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident. Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal. The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8. The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight. Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members. Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014. 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014. 2015.
","Locals from the Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claim they saw a low-flying jet on the morning MH370 disappeared. The island is over 5000 kilometres away from the current search area. Members of the community say it was so low they could see the plane's doors and make out the distinctive colouring on the side of the jet. Locals made statements to verify what they had seen to officials. Curtin University acoustic scientists say they recorded 'distinctive' noise from the area at the presumed time of the crash.

As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident. Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal. The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8. The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight. Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members. Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014. 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014. 2015.
",,The missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is believed to have crashed over 5000 kilometres away from the official search area after low-flying jets were spotted by locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives. The suspected wreckage of the flight shows no signs of human life or the plane. The red and blue markings of the missing plane were identified on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of MH370's disappearance. Acoustic scientists have recorded distinct noise from the area at the presumed time of the crash. This incident marks the end of the tragic and devastating chapter of MH370.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
19,"Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist.

Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott. Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time.

'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage.

The three children who died when their mother's car crashed into a late in Melbourne have been laid to rest. Mourners held on to each other outside the church as the tiny coffins were wheeled inside. Sudanese AFL footballer Majak Daw arrived at the church and signed a book of condolences for the children before making his way inside. During the ceremony, mourners wept as the children's cousin, Makok Kuol, described them as 'three beautiful angels'. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Kuol told the congregation from the pulpit that four-year-old Madit was destined for great things. The crash  killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west. 'Everyone who came to my family's house, you would feel the joy of having this boy run up into your arms,' Mr Kuol said. 'A young, energetic Australian has been ripped from us by the work of the devil. Mr Kuol paid tribute to his 'sweetheart' cousin Anger and said her younger brother BoI was a precious young boy, who will be remembered for 'the best smile, the laughter, and the joy he brought to all of us.' After the ceremony the children were taken to the Werribee Cemetery where they were buried. Mourners wept and clung on to each other as the tiny white coffins were wheeled into the church. Police are still investigating how the car ran off the road and ended up in a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's west on April 8. Police are still investigating how the car ran off the road and ended up in a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's west on April 8. Ms Guode, who was driving, was interviewed after the crash but was released without charge. Police are appealing for witnesses including a woman, believed to be in her 30s, who was walking with a pram near Lake Gladman at Wyndham Vale and may have seen the crash before alerting others. Investigators are also appealing for further help from the South Sudanese community including anyone who knows the family's movements the day of the accident. Last week it was revealed that five-year-old Awel who survived the crash, believes her three siblings who died were eaten by crocodiles. Joseph Tito Manyang (left), the father of three children killed, held hands with a friend as they walked from the church with pink booklets in their hands. Akon Guode (centre), the mother of three children was inconsolable as she witnessed her children being buried. Awel (left) survived the accident that killed her siblings and believes they were eaten by crocodiles. The young girl believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Their father, Joseph Tito Manyang, said Awel remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody last Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told them she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. Ms Guode had been sent to stay with a relative following the crash, after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. Akon Guode told Police she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her kids crying out. She was released from custody after police questioning. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. Sudanese AFL footballer Majak Daw was seen at the service. Mr Daw signed a book of condolences for the kids, who were of Sudanese decent. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on the Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. Mr Daw paid tribute to the children and showed his respects by attending their funeral.

The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent.

Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard. Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday. Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman. Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning. The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore. Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police.

21,"She's a professional equestrienne and was happy to have a go at wheelchair rugby, a sport nicknamed 'murder ball', during last September's Invictus Games. Now Zara Tindall, 33, has turned her hand to barrel-pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband Mike along while striking a pose for the cameras. The moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer Rob Edmond's marathon barrel-roll from Perthshire to Wiltshire. Taking the strain: Zara straps herself into Mr Edmond's barrel-pulling harness. Pull! Zara pretends to move off while husband Mike beams from his perch on the barrel. Edmond, who set off nine days and 517 miles ago, rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day, only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way. The Bell's Barrel of Laughs trek also saw Edmond, who was the personal trainer on ITV's The Biggest Loser, joined by comedians including Fred MacAulay, Mark Dolan and Rufus Hound. Actress Joanna Lumley launched the challenge at the Blair Athol Distillery last week, while Zara was at the finish line at the Tedworth House Help for Heroes recovery centre. Tindall, meanwhile, joined Edmond for the final leg of the challenge - running with the personal trainer as he approached the finish line. 'It was good,' said the 36-year-old afterwards.

21,"She's a professional equestrienne and was happy to have a go at wheelchair rugby, a sport nicknamed 'murder ball', during last September's Invictus Games. Now Zara Tindall, 33, has turned her hand to barrel-pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband Mike along while striking a pose for the cameras. The moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer Rob Edmond's marathon barrel-roll from Perthshire to Wiltshire. Taking the strain: Zara straps herself into Mr Edmond's barrel-pulling harness. Pull! Zara pretends to move off while husband Mike beams from his perch on the barrel. Edmond, who set off nine days and 517 miles ago, rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day, only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way. The Bell's Barrel of Laughs trek also saw Edmond, who was the personal trainer on ITV's The Biggest Loser, joined by comedians including Fred MacAulay, Mark Dolan and Rufus Hound. Actress Joanna Lumley launched the challenge at the Blair Athol Distillery last week, while Zara was at the finish line at the Tedworth House Help for Heroes recovery centre. Tindall, meanwhile, joined Edmond for the final leg of the challenge - running with the personal trainer as he approached the finish line. 'It was good,' said the 36-year-old afterwards.

22,"Like super-models, they follow a strict daily diet — in their case, three carrots, an apple and a few cabbage leaves — to keep in shape for their public appearances. Over recent months, they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go. One is even going to have a song written about his life. But when I meet Darius — the biggest rabbit on earth — and his similarly sized son, there is little evidence of diva behaviour. Former Playboy model Annette Edwards holds her world record Continental Giant rabbit Darius aloft. Five-year-old Darius is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st — the king of the Continental Giant breed. He is the size of an average eight-year-old child. Slightly wary, I join him on the floor of his owner's home in the Worcestershire village of Stoulton and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul. He sits quietly, as I stroke his ultra-soft, grey fur, and examine his outsized ears and paws. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Aged only one, Jeff is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st. With a rabbit's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two, Jeff has got some way to go. 'He's going to get bigger,' says their owner, Annette Edwards. 'His length is amazing. I think he might well take Darius's record.' Annette, a former Playboy model (not a Bunny Girl, it must be noted!), is a genius at giant rabbit-breeding. She has held the record for the world's biggest rabbit, with different animals, since 2008. It would be no surprise if Jeff took the title off his dad: after all, Darius took it from his own mother, Alice. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Annette, who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years, says the art of giant rabbit-breeding is simple. 'It's the same as humans,' she says. 'Some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent. Both parents have got to be big. Jeff's mum, Sally, is 3ft 5in long. She's one of mine, too.' The crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family shouldn't interbreed. 'You mustn't,' Annette stresses. 'You end up with all sorts of illnesses, and overgrown teeth.' Unsurprisingly, nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit- breeding, and Annette admits that Darius is 'very greedy'. As well as those daily carrots, apples and cabbage leaves, her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them. But, even with these hearty appetites, rabbit-breeding is a cheap hobby: £10 a week in grub for both bunnies. And medical care isn't expensive, either. 'They don't need much looking after,' Annette says. 'Only vaccinations against myxomatosis, and solutions to get rid of fly eggs.' Certainly, Darius — recently given a clean bill of health by vets — seems to be in very good condition, as well as being intensely relaxed. It's only when I boldly try to pick him up — it's like lifting a hefty toddler — that he struggles a bit. Apparently, he's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him. 'Darius has more experience with people,' says Annette. 'But he's a little slower. He plods around and follows me more. Jeff follows in his footsteps but he's more energetic because he's younger.' Annette is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits hasn't affected her love life. 'No one has ever minded them,' she says, 'I'd only be with someone who likes animals.' She is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention. 'A lot of giants only live until the age of five. But mine live to eight to ten.' On the sad day that they die, Annette's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree. This devotion to animals began in her childhood. 'I was an only child brought up by my grandmother,' says Annette, who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten. 'I had a couple of rabbits as pets. I adored them — they were my little friends.' Giant genes: Jeff and his giant father Darius - who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit. Annette had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career. She was Miss Birmingham at the age of 29, as well as the Face of Nivea and a Page 3 Girl. She still models — 'mostly magazine work' — and, three years ago, at the age of 60, she was the Sun's oldest ever Page 3 Girl. Her work took her around the world, including New York, where she appeared as a model in Playboy magazine. As her children started to grow up, Annette returned to her love of rabbits. A friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in Holland, where the Continental Giant comes from. In 2004, she bought Amy and Roberto — they were unrelated, so she could breed them. 'My family were a bit shocked — they thought they were the size of dogs! But I loved that they were so big, so gentle and loving — and very different.' At that stage, Annette had no intention of going for any records. But, after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper, she was asked if she had considered applying to the Guinness Book of Records. Like all world records, measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram. To judge their body length, they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw, with legs fully extended. And so it was, in 2008, that Annette learned that 3ft 3in long Amy was a world record holder. Annette has held the record for owner of the world's biggest rabbit ever since. Not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record-collecting, there's keen competition — and Darius is insured 'for a lot of money'. Is his title under threat? Annette says: 'No one's come close so far.' Of course, I bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true. Well, the answer is: yes. Rabbits, giant or otherwise — left to their own devices — can produce 60 young a year. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do. 'That's cruel — it would kill the mothers in the end,' says Annette. 'So I keep them to two litters a year, each of around four or five rabbits. 'It's important to keep them relaxed. When it's warm outside, they like to lie under a tree in the garden. But in cold weather I keep them indoors [in large dog crates] — although it's the damp you should be more worried about — it gets into their bones.' Annette says her rabbits are easy to have about her home. They roam around the kitchen, garden and a small barn. They don't have access to the rest of the house, although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room, wrapped in a blanket. The rabbits cost £500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television — including the Paul O'Grady Show. A musician has asked if he can write a song in Darius's honour, and their record-breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world. Still, the Kardashians of the rabbit world have kept their cool, and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity. Whether Darius retains his title or his son succeeds him, you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe.
","Annette Edwards has owned more than 100 bunnies in the past 10 years. She claims the secret to breeding huge rabbits is both parents must be big. The former Playboy model has owned the world's largest rabbit since 2008. Her rabbit Darius is 4ft in length but he will soon be eclipsed by his son.

24,"An athletic Boston-area high school senior collapsed and died in Greece this week, becoming the third student in his school year to die within six months. Jared Quirk, 18, was in Athens with classmates from Rockland, Massachusetts, to see the ancient world - but fell to the ground while walking through the city with friends, for reasons which are not yet clear. Quirk, who played basketball, baseball, and football at Rockland High School, died a hospital in the Greek capital after being taken there by ambulance, the Boston Globe reported. Sudden death: Jared Quirk, right with his mother and brother, died on Friday in Athens, Greece, while walking with friends. Two others boys who attended Rockland High School with him in Rockland, Massachusetts, also died in the past six months. It was the third day of the trip. Authorities have yet to announce a cause of death for Quirk, whose unexpected passing has plunged Rockland High into mourning for a third time since October. Quirk's death follows that of Joshua Rose, a 17-year-old student at the school, who died suddenly on October 1 for reasons which were not explained in depth. A third contemporary, Patrick Sullivan, 17, was killed in a three-car pileup on New Year's Eve. Other students on the European trip, which was also supposed to take in Italy and last until April 24th, will come home early to grieve. Others: Joshua Rose, left, died on October 1 from an unknown cause, while Patrick Sullivan, right, was killed in a New Year's Eve car crash. Both were 17 and attended Rockland with Quirk. School: Pictured is Rockland High School in Rockland, Massachusetts, where all three were students. According to the Enterprise local newspaper, funeral workers and the State Department are working with Greek counterparts to transport Quirk's body back from Athens. An uncle, who asked not to be named, described Quirk as a 'good, sweet kid' to the Globe. According to a neighbor who spoke to the paper, Quirk was considering going to Boston College, where one of his brothers now studies. Marina McCauley, seemingly a classmate, posted a tribute via Twitter. She said: 'Jared Quirk was probably one of the funniest people in our school. I can't believe this.' An online tribute page dedicated to Quirk had amassed 20 entries by Sunday night, mainly from family friends. One, signed Linda Ricciarelli, read: 'My heart is broken for you. My son Ronnie adored Jared. In time I hope your memories will make your heart smile for this wonderful young man that was taken too soon! Thoughts and prayers are with you.'

25,"Change is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination. It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change? The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time. Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, ""a collection agency"" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents. The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were ""no racial issues"" in his department. Ferguson's ugly, racist emails released. The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.) Without question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black. Ferguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest. Jackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson. But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department. Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process. Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.. The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department. But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States. That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance. In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country. Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do. It's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high. Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.
