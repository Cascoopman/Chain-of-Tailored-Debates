2. **Caused thousands to flee their homes**: The document states that the violence has caused thousands of immigrants to seek refuge at police stations and shelters.

",,South Africa is on the brink of collapse because of a surge in anti-immigrant violence led by the Zulu king's inflammatory comments targeting immigrants. Immigrants are fleeing in droves leaving the government in crisis mode.,1,1,1,1,1,"To evaluate the summary against the document, let's break down the key points:

1. **Surge in Anti-Immigrant Violence**: The document discusses a wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa, which is accurately reflected in the summary.

2. **Cause of Violence**: The summary attributes the violence primarily to the Zulu king's inflammatory comments. While the document mentions these comments as a possible cause, it also states that the cause is ""murky"" and includes other factors such as a labor dispute and unemployment. The summary oversimplifies the cause by placing the blame solely on the Zulu king's comments, which could be seen as a factual hallucination.

3. **Immigrants Fleeing**: The document mentions that thousands of immigrants are seeking refuge at police stations and shelters, which aligns with the summary's claim that immigrants are fleeing.

4. **Government in Crisis Mode**: The document states that the South African government is responding to the violence and has been described as being in ""crisis mode."" This is supported in the summary.

Given these points, the summary does contain a factual hallucination by attributing the surge in violence primarily to the Zulu king's comments without acknowledging the other contributing factors mentioned in the document. Therefore, the summary is not fully supported by the document.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document in relation to the highlighted sentence.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document discusses a wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa, mentioning that it has left several dead and caused many immigrants to seek refuge. It notes that the cause of the violence is unclear, with some attributing it to inflammatory comments from the Zulu king and others to a labor dispute. The document also mentions the fear and stress experienced by immigrants due to this violence and the government's response to the situation.

2. **Highlighted Sentence Analysis**: The highlighted sentence states that ""South Africa is on the brink of collapse because of a surge in anti-immigrant violence led by the Zulu king's inflammatory comments targeting immigrants."" 

   - **""On the brink of collapse""**: The document does not explicitly state that South Africa is on the brink of collapse. While it describes a serious situation, it does not use the term ""collapse.""
   - **""Surge in anti-immigrant violence""**: This is supported by the document, which discusses the recent wave of violence.
   - **""Led by the Zulu king's inflammatory comments targeting immigrants""**: The document mentions that some blame the violence on comments from the Zulu king, but it does not definitively state that the violence is ""led by"" these comments. This implies a stronger causal relationship than what is presented in the document.

3. **Conclusion**: The highlighted sentence makes a strong claim about the state of South Africa and attributes the violence directly to the Zulu king's comments, which is not fully supported by the document. The document presents a more nuanced view of the causes of the violence and does not support the idea that South Africa is on the brink of collapse.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains elements that are not directly supported by the document and makes a definitive claim that is not substantiated.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""South Africa is on the brink of collapse."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Context from the Document**: The document discusses a wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa, mentioning that the violence has caused fear among immigrants and has led to a response from the government. It highlights the complexity of the situation, including factors like unemployment and the government's slow response. However, it does not explicitly state that South Africa is ""on the brink of collapse.""

2. **Summary Analysis**: The summary claims that South Africa is on the brink of collapse due to the surge in anti-immigrant violence, attributing this to the Zulu king's comments. This is a strong assertion that suggests a dire situation, but the document itself does not provide evidence to support the idea of imminent collapse.

3. **Isolated Statement Evaluation**: The isolated statement ""South Africa is on the brink of collapse."" is a definitive claim that implies a severe and immediate crisis. While the document discusses violence and fear, it does not support the conclusion that the country is on the brink of collapse. This statement appears to be an exaggeration or interpretation that is not directly supported by the content of the document.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement is not supported by the document and can be classified as a hallucination.

53,"The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents. According to data released by the Ministry of Defence, some 27 million 5.56 rounds were fired from either the standard SA-80 assault rifle or minimi machine gun. The British Army fired approximately 10,000 rounds from their SA-80 assault rifles during Afghan conflict. Each of the 5.56mm rounds, pictured, used in the SA-80 assault rifle costs approximately 50p. Each round cost approximately 50p. A further two million 9mm rounds were fired from handguns. According to a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror, at least 80,000, 105mm artillery shells - at a cost of £1,250 each - were fired at Taliban positions. Soldiers went through an estimated £5,000 worth of ammunition for the their assault rifles every day during the eight-year conflict. A further 55,000, 30mm rounds were fired from Apache gunships. Each of these rounds costs about £65, but are able to go through solid concrete and can destroy a Taliban vehicle in seconds. The helicopters are able to provide vital close air support for ground troops pinned down by the opposition. SAS veteran Robert Henry Craft told the Mirror: 'The amount of ammo expended shows how British troops in Afghanistan were fighting for their lives every day. 'That so many 9mm rounds were used shows how close the fighting was at times'. The conflict claimed 453 UK lives. One former SAS solider, not pictured, said British troops were fighting for their lives on a daily basis.
","Some 27 million rounds were fired from the Army's SA-80 assault rifles. New figures show that seven rounds were fired every minute at the Taliban. A further 80,000 105mm artillery shells were used during the eight-year war. Apache gunships also blasted  55,000 30mm rounds at the insurgents.

2. **Seven rounds fired every minute**: This statement is not mentioned in the document. While it may be a calculation based on the total rounds fired and the duration of the conflict, it is not directly inferable from the text. Therefore, this could be considered a factual hallucination.

3. **80,000 105mm artillery shells used**: This is also supported by the document, which states, ""at least 80,000, 105mm artillery shells - at a cost of £1,250 each - were fired at Taliban positions.""

53,"The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents. According to data released by the Ministry of Defence, some 27 million 5.56 rounds were fired from either the standard SA-80 assault rifle or minimi machine gun. The British Army fired approximately 10,000 rounds from their SA-80 assault rifles during Afghan conflict. Each of the 5.56mm rounds, pictured, used in the SA-80 assault rifle costs approximately 50p. Each round cost approximately 50p. A further two million 9mm rounds were fired from handguns. According to a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror, at least 80,000, 105mm artillery shells - at a cost of £1,250 each - were fired at Taliban positions. Soldiers went through an estimated £5,000 worth of ammunition for the their assault rifles every day during the eight-year conflict. A further 55,000, 30mm rounds were fired from Apache gunships. Each of these rounds costs about £65, but are able to go through solid concrete and can destroy a Taliban vehicle in seconds. The helicopters are able to provide vital close air support for ground troops pinned down by the opposition. SAS veteran Robert Henry Craft told the Mirror: 'The amount of ammo expended shows how British troops in Afghanistan were fighting for their lives every day. 'That so many 9mm rounds were used shows how close the fighting was at times'. The conflict claimed 453 UK lives. One former SAS solider, not pictured, said British troops were fighting for their lives on a daily basis.

1. **Bullet Count**: The document states that the British Army fired 46 million bullets, while the summary claims ""over 50 million bullets."" This is a factual hallucination because the number of bullets is verifiable and the summary exaggerates the figure.

2. **Artillery Shells**: The summary correctly states that 80,000 artillery shells were fired at a cost of £1,250 each, which is supported by the document.

3. **Nature of the Conflict**: The summary concludes that British soldiers were fighting a difficult and brutal battle against their enemies. This is a reasonable inference based on the document's content, which describes the intense nature of the fighting and the high expenditure of ammunition.

Given that the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the number of bullets fired, we conclude that the summary does contain hallucinated content.

3. However, since the first part of the highlighted sentence contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the total number of bullets fired, it cannot be considered fully supported.

1. The document states that the British Army fired ""46 million bullets"" during the Afghanistan conflict, not ""over 50 million bullets"" as mentioned in the isolated statement. This discrepancy indicates that the isolated statement is not accurate.

2. The document does provide information about the number of artillery shells fired (80,000) and their cost (£1,250 each), which aligns with the summary. However, the key part of the isolated statement regarding the total number of bullets is incorrect.

90,"A husband convicted of beating his wife to death after she filed for divorce has been sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity. The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence. James Robarge (above pictured in court last month), 45, of Vermont was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. Robarge was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge. The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this. Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News. In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.' One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom. 'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday. During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge. And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years. Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.
","James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning. He was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge. Robarge has already served two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years.

90,"A husband convicted of beating his wife to death after she filed for divorce has been sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity. The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence. James Robarge (above pictured in court last month), 45, of Vermont was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. Robarge was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge. The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this. Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News. In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.' One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom. 'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday. During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge. And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years. Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.

2. The isolated statement simplifies the information by stating ""He has been sentenced to life in prison,"" which does not accurately reflect the specifics of the sentence given in the document.

141,"Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. Although he too was touted as a ""perfect"" candidate who was the ideal person for the job, something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail. He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling. Gore had trouble connecting with voters, and he seemed to remake his image constantly. His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee, rather than what he actually stood for. Clinton must avoid following Gore's path. She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and can't afford to do so again. She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience. That is not enough. More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House. Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents, even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change. A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability. After the announcement, they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity. In his first day on the campaign trail, Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted. That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. Their greatest virtue, their immense skills as politicians, has often come back to haunt them. Bill Clinton was attacked as ""slick Willie"" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism. When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq, many Democrats didn't buy her critique of President George W. Bush's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead. When she conducted her ""listening tour"" of New York before running for the Senate, many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider. When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email, some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn't always telling us what she was really about. Even if she isn't hiding anything, she often gives that appearance. During the next few months, Clinton will also have to connect with her party's base. The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton's candidacy. While they will probably vote for her, they are not very motivated and don't trust that she will stand for Democratic values. She will need to address these concerns, not through her style but through her agenda. Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing. She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran. Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large. Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance, for instance -- that won't be aimed at male candidates. Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism. But the struggle will be tough. Finally, and this relates to the last challenge, Clinton will have to contend with her husband. To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail, one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation. But he can also be liability. As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control. When he speaks his mind, as he did in dismissive comments about Obama's candidacy, it can often work against her. The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest, and ongoing stories about his personal life, as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago, could re-emerge on the campaign trail. Whether that is fair or not is beside the point: Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail. Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate. But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months.

141,"Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. Although he too was touted as a ""perfect"" candidate who was the ideal person for the job, something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail. He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling. Gore had trouble connecting with voters, and he seemed to remake his image constantly. His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee, rather than what he actually stood for. Clinton must avoid following Gore's path. She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and can't afford to do so again. She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience. That is not enough. More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House. Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents, even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change. A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability. After the announcement, they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity. In his first day on the campaign trail, Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted. That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. Their greatest virtue, their immense skills as politicians, has often come back to haunt them. Bill Clinton was attacked as ""slick Willie"" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism. When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq, many Democrats didn't buy her critique of President George W. Bush's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead. When she conducted her ""listening tour"" of New York before running for the Senate, many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider. When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email, some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn't always telling us what she was really about. Even if she isn't hiding anything, she often gives that appearance. During the next few months, Clinton will also have to connect with her party's base. The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton's candidacy. While they will probably vote for her, they are not very motivated and don't trust that she will stand for Democratic values. She will need to address these concerns, not through her style but through her agenda. Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing. She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran. Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large. Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance, for instance -- that won't be aimed at male candidates. Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism. But the struggle will be tough. Finally, and this relates to the last challenge, Clinton will have to contend with her husband. To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail, one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation. But he can also be liability. As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control. When he speaks his mind, as he did in dismissive comments about Obama's candidacy, it can often work against her. The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest, and ongoing stories about his personal life, as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago, could re-emerge on the campaign trail. Whether that is fair or not is beside the point: Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail. Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate. But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months.

Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. Scroll down for video.

Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'. Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population. The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding.

The term ""posh"" is not explicitly used in the document, but it does describe them as being from a ""wealthy seaside village."" This part of the summary is generally supported, although the use of ""posh"" could be seen as an embellishment.

2. **""Police are investigating a possible abduction but say there is no hard evidence to suggest the family is in danger.""**
   - The document states that police do not expect foul play and have no hard evidence suggesting that the Costellos may be in danger. However, it does not mention an investigation into a ""possible abduction."" This introduces a factual hallucination since the summary implies a direction of investigation that is not supported by the document.

3. **""The mother, a well-known equestrian, had been scheduled to return to work but has not been heard from since.""**
   - The document confirms that Iona Costello was a well-known equestrian and that she had told workers at her farm she would be ""back on Tuesday,"" but it does not explicitly state that she was ""scheduled to return to work."" This could be interpreted as a factual hallucination since the summary implies a work schedule that is not directly supported by the document.

2. The summary states that police are investigating a possible abduction, which is a claim that is not directly supported by the document. The document does not indicate that the police are actively investigating an abduction; rather, it emphasizes the lack of evidence for foul play or danger.

3. Since the isolated statement suggests an active investigation into a possible abduction, which is not supported by the document's content, it can be classified as a factual hallucination. The document does not provide any information that confirms the police are investigating a possible abduction.

219,"A 12-year-old Israeli girl is missing after a tour boat she was on exploded and caught fire off Thailand's southwestern coast on its way to Phuket. The youngster was thought to have been in the toilet on board the Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry which was carrying more than 100 people, including many foreign tourists, when the incident happened at around 3.30pm local time. Passengers were throwing themselves into the Andaman Sea after the engine exploded and flames ripped through the boat, according to the Bangkok Post. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. The Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry burns after the engine exploded in the Andaman Sea in Krabi province. A 12-year-old Israeli girl who was reportedly in the toilet at the time is still thought to be missing. Thick black smoke can be seen rising from the stricken vessel. Between 100 and 110 passengers and crew had to be rescued by a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft. The Associated Press reported that the 12-year-old girl may have been picked up by another boat that was going to the beach resort of Phuket. But Police Captain Sutthiwat Aunsiam, a duty officer at Muang Krabi station, told Jor Sor 100 radio late in the evening that rescue units are still searching for the girl and Krabi Governor Songpol Sawasditham confirmed her disappearance, according to Thai Rath Online. Most of the passengers and crew, totalling between 100 and 110, were taken back to Ao Nang near the resort town of Krabi from where the Ao Nang Princess 5 originally set off. About a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft from police and marine authorities assisted in the rescue operation. More rescue staff and divers, including personnel from Third Naval Area Command, will join the search for the missing girl tomorrow. None of those brought ashore were reported to be injured, but one person aboard the boat did die, according to Phuket News. Pol Capt Sutthiwat quoted Wirat Jittaraporn, the captain of the 35-metre long, 4.5-metre wide ferry, as saying the vessel was about five miles from Railay beach near Ao Nang when he heard an explosion from the engine room. He immediately ordered everyone to don life jackets and prepare to abandon ship. The fire quickly engulfed the ferry and burned it to the waterline before it sank at around 6pm off Krabi's Noppharat Thara beach. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. Passenger Panupon Rattanakornpanya, 44, told Thai Rath Online, that crew members told him and his wife and child that a fire had broken out and ordered everyone to gather at the bow. 'The fire then grew stronger. Everyone was in a panic. Some were crying. Many grabbed jackets and passed them on to others before we jumped into the water,' he said. Governor Songpol said the ferry was equipped with fire extinguishers, 'but in this case it appeared [the crew] were not able to control the blaze and this must be investigated again'. The governor went to Ao Nang, a popular hopping off point for Phi Phi, Phuket, Koh Lanta and other islands, as passengers from the sunken vessel milled on the shore. 'We hope the girl is still alive,' said the Director of Marine Office 5 for the region, Wichai Kamwong, according to Phuketwan. 'The ferry burned with remarkable speed so to have the speedboats and fishing trawlers close by to help was wonderful.' The sunken ferry was operated by Ao Nang Travel and Tour Co. Thailand's tourist industry, which welcomes more than 20 million people a year, has suffered a black eye in recent years due to domestic political violence and several high-profile killings and unexplained accidental deaths of Westerners, but serious marine accidents are uncommon.

The explosion occurred off Thailand's southwestern coast, but the document does not specify that it happened in Phuket. It mentions that the ferry was on its way to Phuket, but the explosion itself happened while the ferry was near Krabi.

3. **""Tourists on board threw themselves into the water to escape.""** - This is supported by the document, which states that passengers were throwing themselves into the Andaman Sea after the engine exploded.

4. **""The boat was owned by the Ao Nang Travel and Tour Co.""** - This is supported by the document, which mentions that the sunken ferry was operated by Ao Nang Travel and Tour Co.

5. **""and was sailing from Krabi to Phuket.""** - This is supported by the document, which indicates that the ferry set off from Ao Nang near Krabi and was headed to Phuket.

6. **""There were no injuries reported on the way.""** - This is misleading.

1. The document states that Maria Twomey changed her diet from eating takeaways and fatty snacks to a healthier diet, which included poached eggs, lean chicken, and nuts. This indicates that she indeed swapped unhealthy food for healthier options.

2. The document mentions that she engaged in weight-lifting and intense workouts on the exercise bike, which aligns with the idea of swapping her previous lifestyle for a more active one.

3. However, the document does not specifically mention ""HIIT workouts."" While it does mention intense workouts, it does not explicitly state that these workouts were categorized as High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence is partially supported by the document in terms of swapping unhealthy food for healthier options and engaging in weight-lifting. However, the specific mention of ""HIIT workouts"" is not directly supported by the text.

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"The highlighted sentence states that ""Maria Twomey, 42, underwent a major weight loss surgery to lose five dress sizes and become a professional fitness model."" 

Upon reviewing the document, there is no mention of Maria undergoing any weight loss surgery. Instead, the document details her transformation through diet changes and exercise, specifically weight-lifting and workouts on an exercise bike. Therefore, the claim of her undergoing surgery is not supported by the document and is a factual hallucination.

Thus, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Maria Twomey underwent a major weight loss surgery."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document describes Maria Twomey's journey of weight loss and transformation into a fitness model. It mentions that she lost five dress sizes and changed her diet and exercise routine significantly.
2. However, there is no mention of her undergoing any weight loss surgery. The document emphasizes her hard work, personal training, and changes in diet and exercise as the means through which she achieved her weight loss.
3. The statement in question claims that she underwent ""major weight loss surgery,"" which is not supported by the information provided in the document. This is a factual hallucination because it introduces a detail (surgery) that is not present in the document.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

A teenage girl was shocked to discover a huge albino snake curled up on top of the radiator in her bathroom. Hannah Brierley, 16, thought her mother was playing a prank when she spotted the six foot-long northern pine snake on a bath mat which was hung up to dry at her home in Rochdale, Manchester. She stared at the reptile for a few minutes until it moved and quickly called for her 40-year-old mother, Karen Marriott, to come upstairs. Mrs Marriott attempted to call the RSCPA at 7am yesterday morning but after she was unable to get through she panicked and dialled 999. She said: 'Hannah was calm at first. She can't even deal with spiders, but I don't think she thought it was real. 'She'd been looking at it for a few minutes until it moved. She thought I was having a joke.

Shocked: It was found by 16-year-old Hannah Brierley who thought at first it might be a prank by her mother. Terrifying: Her mother Karen Marriott couldn't get hold of the RSPCA so called the police to help them. Rescue: Det Con Craig Wallace, who keeps snakes, overheard the call and although it wasn't a police matter, he wanted to help the terrified family and used a pillowcase to capture it.

Most hatchlings, which are around 12 to 16 inches, will feed immediately and though they may strike and hiss at first, with frequent handling they usually calm down. Adults, which grow between 4ft and 6ft, can be more difficult to calm down if the animal was not handled frequently as a hatchling or juvenile.

2. **""The six foot-long albino northern pine snake gave a nasty bite, but it was not venomous.""**
   - The document states that the northern pine snake can give a nasty bite but is not venomous. This part of the summary is also supported.

3. **""It had escaped from a local zoo before entering the house through the floorboards.""**
   - The document suggests that the snake may have escaped or been set free and slithered into the house, but it does not mention anything about it escaping from a local zoo. This introduces a factual hallucination, as the summary presents information that is not supported by the document.

4. **""The police helped capture the reptile, but it tragically died during transportation.""**

The Republican presidential hopefuls told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in separate interviews on Tuesday that they'd enforce federal drug laws and block the sale of marijuana in Colorado and Washington. 'Marijuana is a gateway drug,' Christie said, citing an 'enormous addiction problem in this country.' 'And we need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement. Marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law. And the states should not be permitted to sell it and profit from it.' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, center, makes a campaign stop at Rockingham County GOP Happy Hour on Tuesday in Newmarket, New Hampshire, with his wife Mary Pat, right. During a radio interview that day, Christie, a candidate-in-waiting, said, 'Marijuana is a gateway drug' and claimed America has an 'enormous addiction problem.' he added, 'We need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement' U.S. Senator Marco Rubio is pictured here on Monday with his wife Jeanette as he announces his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a Miami, Florida, event. Talking about weed on Tuesday, he said, 'I think we need to enforce our federal laws' Asked for his position on the topic, Rubio said 'I think we need to enforce our federal laws.' Rubio, who on Monday made official his candidacy, said he believes in states' rights - but laws created by the federal government legally supersede those of the states. 'I don’t believe we should be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants in this country for the primary reason that when you legalize something, what you’re sending a message to young people is it can’t be that bad, because if it was that bad, it wouldn’t be legal,' the Florida senator said. Questioned about cannabis last year by ABC News' Jon Karl, Rubio took a hard-line stance, saying, 'I think there’s no responsible way to recreationally use marijuana.' 'I don’t want my kids to smoke marijuana, and I don’t want other people’s kids to smoke marijuana,' he said at the time. He refused to tell Karl if he'd engaged in any marijuana-related youthful indiscretions, arguing that his answer would either set a bad example for young people or make him look like a liar. Christie has also forcefully denounced marijuana legalization, saying last March, 'I don't favor legalization. I don't favor recreational use. I don't favor decriminalization. And I don't favor the use of marijuana as a medicine.' Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the first Republican to officially enter the 2016 race, also supports stricter enforcement of current law and has said he is against legalizing weed. He's also said he's willing to have an 'intelligent conversation' about drug policy, however. Other GOP contenders, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tossed his hat in the ring last week, and former Texas Governor Rick Perry, a presumed candidate, have taken a softer approach to the budding discussion - they're in favor decriminalization.

In the course of his conversation with Hewitt on Tuesday Rubio defended his framing of Clinton as past her prime and said he was knocking her 'ideas,' not her age. 'Age is a legitimate issue,' he said, 'not the age of the people, the age of their ideas...I’m just saying that the things that worked in the last century don’t work that well now.' The jobs that served as the base of our economy before 'either don’t exist' now or 'they have been shipped overseas or they don’t pay what they once used to relative to the cost of living,' he said, asserting that 'we have to fully embrace the opportunities of the 21st Century.' 'We need leaders that understand that and have an idea about how the 21st Century can also be a new American century.' He later predicted that Clinton would 'struggle to connect with everyday Americans and their struggles of daily life' on the campaign trail. 'I mean, and that’s a big problem,' he said. 'That’s one of the reasons why her ideas are so outdated. They’re still ideas based on an era that came and went.' Christie said in his interview with Hewitt that he also thinks Clinton is vulnerable and promised, 'If I run, I will beat her.'

273,"Dope smokers beware: If Marco Rubio or Chris Christie manage to elbow out the competition and win the White House in 2016, they'll crack down on pot in states that have legalized marijuana. The Republican presidential hopefuls told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in separate interviews on Tuesday that they'd enforce federal drug laws and block the sale of marijuana in Colorado and Washington. 'Marijuana is a gateway drug,' Christie said, citing an 'enormous addiction problem in this country.' 'And we need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement. Marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law. And the states should not be permitted to sell it and profit from it.' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, center, makes a campaign stop at Rockingham County GOP Happy Hour on Tuesday in Newmarket, New Hampshire, with his wife Mary Pat, right. During a radio interview that day, Christie, a candidate-in-waiting, said, 'Marijuana is a gateway drug' and claimed America has an 'enormous addiction problem.' he added, 'We need to send very clear leadership from the White House on down through the federal law enforcement' U.S. Senator Marco Rubio is pictured here on Monday with his wife Jeanette as he announces his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a Miami, Florida, event. Talking about weed on Tuesday, he said, 'I think we need to enforce our federal laws' Asked for his position on the topic, Rubio said 'I think we need to enforce our federal laws.' Rubio, who on Monday made official his candidacy, said he believes in states' rights - but laws created by the federal government legally supersede those of the states. 'I don’t believe we should be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants in this country for the primary reason that when you legalize something, what you’re sending a message to young people is it can’t be that bad, because if it was that bad, it wouldn’t be legal,' the Florida senator said. Questioned about cannabis last year by ABC News' Jon Karl, Rubio took a hard-line stance, saying, 'I think there’s no responsible way to recreationally use marijuana.' 'I don’t want my kids to smoke marijuana, and I don’t want other people’s kids to smoke marijuana,' he said at the time. He refused to tell Karl if he'd engaged in any marijuana-related youthful indiscretions, arguing that his answer would either set a bad example for young people or make him look like a liar. Christie has also forcefully denounced marijuana legalization, saying last March, 'I don't favor legalization. I don't favor recreational use. I don't favor decriminalization. And I don't favor the use of marijuana as a medicine.' Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the first Republican to officially enter the 2016 race, also supports stricter enforcement of current law and has said he is against legalizing weed. He's also said he's willing to have an 'intelligent conversation' about drug policy, however. Other GOP contenders, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tossed his hat in the ring last week, and former Texas Governor Rick Perry, a presumed candidate, have taken a softer approach to the budding discussion - they're in favor decriminalization. The youngest major presidential candidate this election season, 43-year-old Rubio is presenting himself as a fresh face with forward-thinking ideas compared to candidates of 'yesterday' - a not-so-subtle attack on 67-year-old Democrat Hillary Clinton. He's pictured here at his campaign launch with his wife and four children. Christie and his wife Mary Pat greet diners at Chez Vachon in Manchester, New Hampshire. The governor is on a four-day swing through the first in the nation primary state as he explores a run for the Republican nomination for president.  Christie said in his interview Tuesday he thinks he thinks Clinton is vulnerable and promised, 'If I run, I will beat her' The youngest major presidential candidate this election season, 43-year-old Rubio is presenting himself as a fresh face with forward-thinking ideas compared to candidates of 'yesterday' - a not-so-subtle attack on 67-year-old Democrat Hillary Clinton. In the course of his conversation with Hewitt on Tuesday Rubio defended his framing of Clinton as past her prime and said he was knocking her 'ideas,' not her age. 'Age is a legitimate issue,' he said, 'not the age of the people, the age of their ideas...I’m just saying that the things that worked in the last century don’t work that well now.' The jobs that served as the base of our economy before 'either don’t exist' now or 'they have been shipped overseas or they don’t pay what they once used to relative to the cost of living,' he said, asserting that 'we have to fully embrace the opportunities of the 21st Century.' 'We need leaders that understand that and have an idea about how the 21st Century can also be a new American century.' He later predicted that Clinton would 'struggle to connect with everyday Americans and their struggles of daily life' on the campaign trail. 'I mean, and that’s a big problem,' he said. 'That’s one of the reasons why her ideas are so outdated. They’re still ideas based on an era that came and went.' Christie said in his interview with Hewitt that he also thinks Clinton is vulnerable and promised, 'If I run, I will beat her.'

She handed over her ATM card, which the suspects used to fill the van with gas, and was taken to a cemetery where she was zip-tied and dumped from the van. She freed her hands and tied to flee but the suspects returned and put her in shackles and handcuffs. The suspects again demanded information from the woman who was unable to tell them anything and they abandoned her in the cemetery. The woman was treated at a local hospital for broken ribs and a concussion. The victim, whose identity has not been released, was traumatized by what had happened, police reported.

1. **Capture of Khayree Gay**: The summary states that Khayree Gay was captured at the Security Inn and Suites hotel in Lake City, South Carolina, which is supported by the document.

2. **Federal Charges**: The summary mentions that Gay is facing federal charges for allegedly kidnapping a Jewelers Row employee on April 4 in Philadelphia. This is also supported by the document.

3. **Details of the Abduction**: The summary describes the woman, aged 53, being abducted in a van from a parking garage, which aligns with the document's description of the incident.

4. **Assault Details**: The summary states that the woman was beaten, Tasered, and threatened with death. The document confirms that she was beaten and shot with a Taser seven times, and was told she was going to die, so this is also supported.

5. **Aftermath of the Abduction**: The summary claims that she was left handcuffed in a Pennsylvania cemetery following the abduction. The document states that she was taken to a cemetery where she was zip-tied and dumped from the van, and later put in shackles and handcuffs. However, it does not explicitly state that she was left handcuffed in the cemetery, which could imply a slight misrepresentation of the events.

Overall, while the summary captures the essence of the document, the phrasing ""left handcuffed in a Pennsylvania cemetery"" could be seen as an interpretation that is not directly supported by the document, as it does not explicitly state that she was left in that condition.

The former Secretary of State gave details of her daughter's pregnancy in a new Epilogue for her memoir, Hard Choices, released just days before she is expected to announce her presidential run. In the new chapter, shared by the Huffington Post on Friday, she suggested that the birth of her granddaughter made her think about the future of all children and had motivated her political plans. She explained how in 2014, she and her husband got the 'wonderful news' that their daughter Chelsea and her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky were expecting a baby. Doting: Hillary Clinton, pictured with her husband Bill and their granddaughter Charlotte after her birth last year, has said the baby girl has made her realize she has much more work to do.

Bill ended up bringing enough to fill a thirty-nine-gallon garbage bag. It was quite a sight. 'By comparison, Chelsea and Marc were much more organized and prepared.'

Similar to the first point, the document indicates that she is expected to announce her bid on Sunday, but it does not confirm that she has already started her campaign. This could also be considered a factual hallucination.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains hallucinated content regarding the announcement of her presidential bid and the starting of her campaign, as these details are not confirmed in the document. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",0,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""She will be starting her campaign on Sunday."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

The document mentions that Hillary Clinton is expected to announce her presidential run and that she has rented space for her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. It also states that she will announce her bid to run for president on Sunday before traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with voters.

The highlighted sentence directly states that she will be starting her campaign on Sunday, which aligns with the information provided in the document about her announcement and subsequent campaign activities.

Since the highlighted sentence can be inferred from the document and is consistent with the details provided, it is classified as [SUPPORTED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Hillary Clinton whooped with delight upon hearing the news."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and see if this statement can be inferred or is directly stated.

1. The document mentions that Hillary Clinton was ""unabashedly giddy"" at the news of her granddaughter's birth and that there was ""laughter and excited whoops"" from her and Bill after Chelsea emerged from labor. This indicates that Hillary expressed joy and excitement about the news of her granddaughter's birth.

2. The isolated statement specifically states that ""Hillary Clinton whooped with delight upon hearing the news."" The document supports the idea that she was very happy and expressed that joy, but it does not explicitly state that she ""whooped"" at the moment of hearing the news; rather, it describes her reaction after the birth.

3. The phrase ""whooped with delight"" is consistent with the overall sentiment expressed in the document, but the timing of the ""whooping"" is not precisely aligned with the isolated statement, as it refers to her reaction after the birth rather than upon hearing the news.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement is closely related to the document's content but is not directly supported as it implies a specific timing (upon hearing the news) that is not explicitly stated in the document.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

1. **Car plunging off the road**: The document confirms that a car did indeed veer off the edge of the harbor and into the water, which supports the claim that a car plunged into the Los Angeles harbor.

2. **Two children pulled from the submerged vehicle**: The document mentions that divers found the two boys inside the car and that they had no pulses and weren't breathing when brought up. However, it does not state that they were hospitalized; rather, it indicates that they were not alive when pulled from the water. Therefore, the part of the sentence claiming that the two children were hospitalized is not supported by the document.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the hospitalization of the children, as they were deceased when pulled from the vehicle.

Thus, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The two children were hospitalized"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Document Analysis**: The document states that ""Divers found the two boys inside the car. They had no pulses and weren't breathing when divers brought them up, and resuscitation efforts began immediately."" This indicates that the two boys were not alive when they were pulled from the water, and there is no mention of them being hospitalized.

2. **Summary Analysis**: The summary states that ""two children pulled from the submerged vehicle were hospitalized."" However, this contradicts the information in the document, which indicates that both boys were dead when they were retrieved from the water.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the isolated statement claims that the two children were hospitalized, but the document indicates they were deceased, this is an intrinsic hallucination. The statement contradicts the information provided in the document.

339,"An eight-year-old boy has died a day after his family's car hurtled off the road and into a Los Angeles harbor. His 13-year-old brother, identified as Abdelkrim Elmezayen, was pulled dead from the water at the scene shortly after 6pm on Thursday. Their parents are in a stable condition in the hospital. Firefighters rushed to the port in San Pedro  when passers-by heard cries for help. The family of four had been driving out of a parking lot on Berth 73 when the vehicle, driven by the boys' father, veered off the edge of the harbor. Scroll down for video.

Sucessful search: Divers emerge from the water as debris believed to be from the car floats to the surface where a car went off the berth and into the water. Divers working in murky water searched the car and even opened the trunk, but they found no one else in it, Humphrey said. The cause of the accident was under investigation. 'We don't know at this time whether it was an accident or an intentional event,' he said. Nearly 100 firefighters, divers and helicopter and boat crews went to the scene, Humphrey said.

Firefighter Miguel Meza's quick thinking and bravery saved the family from the capsized vehicle.",1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document step-by-step:

1. **Family of four had a miraculous escape**: The document states that the two boys died and their parents were in the hospital. This contradicts the claim of a ""miraculous escape,"" as the children did not survive. This is an intrinsic hallucination.

2. **Children were rescued immediately and rushed to the hospital**: The document indicates that the children were found without pulses and were not breathing when pulled from the water, which means they were not rescued in a state that would allow for immediate survival. This is also an intrinsic hallucination.

3. **Both parents were in fair condition and emotionally stable**: The document states that the parents were in a stable condition but described as ""clearly emotionally distraught."" The term ""emotionally stable"" contradicts the document, which indicates they were distressed. This is another intrinsic hallucination.

4. **Witnesses claimed the car accelerated as it approached the water, prompting speculation that it was a premeditated act**: The document does mention that witnesses heard screeching tires and that the car appeared to speed up, which aligns with the summary. However, the speculation about it being a premeditated act is not directly supported by the document, which states that the cause of the accident is under investigation. This could be seen as a factual hallucination.

5. **Firefighter Miguel Meza's quick thinking and bravery saved the family from the capsized vehicle**: The document praises Firefighter Miguel Meza for his actions, but it does not state that he saved the family, as both children died. This is an intrinsic hallucination.

Overall, the summary contains multiple instances of intrinsic hallucinations and some factual hallucinations. Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Final response: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document in relation to the highlighted sentence.

The highlighted sentence states: ""A family of four had a miraculous escape after their car plunged into a harbor in Los Angeles.""

1. **Content of the Document**: The document describes a tragic incident where a family of four's car plunged into a harbor in Los Angeles. It mentions that two children died, and their parents were in stable condition but emotionally distraught. The document does not indicate that the family had a miraculous escape; rather, it highlights the deaths of the two boys and the serious nature of the incident.

2. **Analysis of the Highlighted Sentence**:
   - The phrase ""miraculous escape"" implies that the family was able to avoid serious harm or death, which contradicts the information in the document that states two children died.
   - The document does not support the idea of a miraculous escape; instead, it presents a tragic outcome for the children.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the highlighted sentence contradicts the information provided in the document, it falls under the category of intrinsic hallucinations.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""A family of four had a miraculous escape."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Document Analysis**: The document describes a tragic incident where a family's car plunged into a harbor, resulting in the deaths of two children and leaving the parents in stable condition. It does not mention a miraculous escape; rather, it emphasizes the severity of the situation, including the deaths of the children and the emotional distress of the parents.

2. **Summary Analysis**: The summary states that the family had a ""miraculous escape,"" which contradicts the document's details about the deaths of the children. The use of the term ""miraculous escape"" implies that all family members were saved, which is not the case according to the document.

3. **Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement reiterates the summary's claim about a miraculous escape. Given that the document does not support this claim and instead presents a tragic outcome, the statement cannot be inferred from the document.

He then threw the glass balls from the public gallery, but they missed MPs and hit a security screen. Abberley excused himself to fellow observers before shouting 'you are all just liars' at Prime Minister David Cameron and the rest of the chamber during the televised Parliamentary debate. When arrested, Abberley told police officers that he had daubed the words 'the enemy within' in red paint on the palace's walls, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told. Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon said the incident happened five minutes before the end of the weekly question-and-answer session. She said: 'Without warning at 12.25pm, Mr Abberley stood up and began to shout, ""I'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen"".

Ms Ramkissoon continued: 'He produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen, causing a loud bang.' The prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen, but the marbles scattered causing 'distress and shock' to the people in the gallery. 'When he was arrested, Abberley made admissions to the arresting officer concerning criminal damage to the Palace of Westminster', she said.

Ms Ramkissoon said it cost £2,416 to remove the graffiti. The court heard that Abberley, whose mother was in court today, is taking medication for mental health and a behavioural disorder. He said that he is looking for a job, and is hoping to join the Army. Abberley, from Carshalton, south London, admitted one count of criminal damage and one of threatening behaviour. District Judge Quentin Purdy sentenced him to eight weeks in prison for throwing the marbles and four weeks for the graffiti, but suspended both jail terms. 'Your personal view of politicians, whatever they may be, are entirely a matter for you,' he said. The unemployed 28-year-old was given suspended sentences for criminal damage and threatening behaviour. 'But the difficult you have is how you chose to express it, by criminal damage and your antics in the gallery at the House of Commons. 'People are entitled to go to that place and listen calmly to that said below. You chose to disrupt them.' The judge said Abberley had caused 'disquiet' which may force others to think again about attending Parliament. 'Those that cause disruption at the Palace of Westminster have a knock-on effect to other freedoms and confidence in going that, and that must be actively deterred.'

4. **Suspended Sentences for Threatening Behaviour and Criminal Damage**: The document states that Abberley was given suspended sentences for criminal damage and threatening behaviour, which is accurately reflected in the summary.

1. **Content Verification**:
   - The summary states that Steven Abberley was sentenced to prison for throwing marbles at MPs and shouting 'you are all just liars' during Prime Minister's Questions. This is supported by the document, which describes the incident and confirms that he was sentenced to eight weeks in prison for throwing the marbles.
   - The summary mentions that he caused damage to the Palace of Westminster, which cost more than £2,000 to remove. The document states that it cost £2,416 to remove the graffiti, which aligns with the summary's claim, although it rounds down the figure.
   - The summary claims that Abberley's sentence was suspended due to his good behavior. The document confirms that both jail terms were suspended, but it does not explicitly mention ""good behavior"" as the reason for the suspension.

2. **Hallucination Types**:
   - **Factual Hallucination**: There is no factual hallucination present since the summary's claims about the incident and the costs are verifiable and align with the document.
   - **Non-factual Hallucination**: There are no non-factual hallucinations, as all entities mentioned in the summary are present in the document.

350,"The Tories are set to steal Labour’s thunder by unveiling tax breaks for workers on the minimum wage. A text message intended for a senior aide to George Osborne – but accidentally sent to a newspaper – yesterday divulged plans for a ‘tax free minimum wage’. The details are unclear, but it is thought this would mean that those on the minimum wage would be exempt from paying any income tax – even if its level is raised in future. New plan: The details of George Osborne's leaked plans are unclear, but it is believed to mean that minimum wage earners wouldn' t be paying any income tax. The minimum wage currently stands at £6.50 an hour, rising to £6.70 in October. Labour’s Ed Miliband yesterday pledged that he would help low earners by raising the level above £8 an hour by October 2019. But the Conservatives look set to outflank both Labour and the Lib Dems on the issue of low pay with a firm commitment in their own manifesto, released today. David Cameron said in his speech to the Conservative party conference last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax – currently £10,600 – go up to £12,500 by April 2020. This will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether, while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth £500 a year. Critique: Danny Alexander said Osborne’s spending plans are 'becoming less and less credible' But if Mr Cameron goes further by also raising the minimum wage – and still keeping everyone on it out of tax – then that would represent a major giveaway. Tax cuts for the low paid are a priority for the Prime Minister after promising to raise the inheritance tax threshold and the 40p rate of tax for those on higher incomes. A text message from Downing Street intended for the Chancellor’s adviser, Neil O’ Brien, read: ‘Hi Neil, Have sent you the tax free min wage press notice draft. Rupert asks if you could print for George in no11?’ Rupert refers to Rupert Harrison, the Chancellor’s most senior economic adviser. The text message ended up being sent to a journalist at The Guardian. It is thought that it refers to a guarantee that, every time the minimum wage rises, its recipients would be protected from paying any income tax. Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said it would be another unfunded spending commitment. He added:‘George Osborne’s spending plans are becoming less and less credible by the day, and it’s embarrassing. ‘They now expect the public to believe them when they make unfunded promises with one hand, whilst decimating family budgets and public services with the other.’ Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour party, said: ‘The Tories are making panicky promises with absolutely no idea how they will pay for them.’ Mr Miliband yesterday brought forward by one year his pledge to increase the minimum wage to £8.

",,The UK government is set to completely abolish income tax for all minimum wage earners as part of their manifesto. The move is a bold one and has received criticism from opposition parties.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document discusses a proposal by the Conservative party (the Tories) to implement a 'tax free minimum wage' which would exempt minimum wage earners from paying income tax. However, it does not state that income tax will be completely abolished for all minimum wage earners; rather, it suggests that they would not pay income tax even if the minimum wage is raised in the future.

2. **Summary Claims**: The summary claims that the UK government is set to ""completely abolish income tax for all minimum wage earners."" This is a stronger assertion than what is presented in the document. The document mentions a proposal for a tax-free minimum wage but does not indicate a complete abolition of income tax for all minimum wage earners.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document in relation to the isolated statement.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document discusses a leaked text message that suggests plans for a ""tax free minimum wage,"" which implies that minimum wage earners would not pay income tax. However, it does not explicitly state that income tax will be completely abolished for all minimum wage earners. Instead, it suggests that they would be exempt from paying income tax, even if the minimum wage level is raised in the future.

2. **Summary Statement**: The summary states that the UK government is set to ""completely abolish income tax for all minimum wage earners."" This is a stronger claim than what is supported by the document, which only indicates that minimum wage earners would be exempt from income tax.

3. **Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement mirrors the summary's claim about completely abolishing income tax for all minimum wage earners.

4. **Analysis of Hallucination Types**:
   - **Factual Hallucination**: The statement claims a complete abolition of income tax, which is not supported by the document. The document suggests an exemption but does not confirm a complete abolition.
   - **Non-factual Hallucination**: There are no entities in the statement that are unverifiable or fictional.
   - **Intrinsic Hallucination**: The statement does not contradict the document but rather misrepresents the extent of the tax changes discussed.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement is not supported by the document because it makes a definitive claim (complete abolition) that is not substantiated by the information provided. Therefore, the isolated statement is classified as:

",,A Brazilian drug gang was busted by police and their loyal dog was also arrested alongside them. The dog's clever trick of surrendering on its back prevented it from being shot by police.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document describes an incident where a dog belonging to a Brazilian drugs gang laid down and rolled over when police arrived to arrest the gang members. The dog did not get arrested and was noted for its behavior of submission, which is a sign of not wanting to cause trouble. The document also mentions that the police recovered drugs and weapons during the bust.

2. **Summary Analysis**:
   - The summary states that ""A Brazilian drug gang was busted by police and their loyal dog was also arrested alongside them."" This is a factual hallucination because the document explicitly states that the dog was not arrested.
   - The summary also claims that ""The dog's clever trick of surrendering on its back prevented it from being shot by police."" While the document mentions that the dog laid down and rolled over, it does not state that this action was a ""trick"" or that it specifically prevented the dog from being shot. This could be seen as an interpretation that is not directly supported by the text.

3. **Conclusion**: The summary contains factual hallucinations regarding the arrest of the dog and the interpretation of its actions. Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Henry scored 26, Eto’o 36 and Messi 38 goals in the 2008-09 season. In this campaign Messi has 46, Neymar 28 and Suarez 19 despite missing the first three months through suspension. Scroll down for video. Lionel Messi, Neymar Jnr and Luis Suarez are seven goals short of reaching 100 for the season.

Gareth Bale with 17, Cristiano Ronaldo with 50, and Karim Benzema 22, have 86 between them for Real Madrid but the question is no longer can Messi, Suarez and Neymar out-do their La Liga rivals, rather can they out-do the greatest forward lines in Barcelona’s history? The Henry/Eto’o/Messi forward line won the 2009 European Cup and was followed two years later – after the failed attempt to bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic into the mix in 2010 – by the Messi/David Villa/Pedro strike force that also won a European Cup against Manchester United in 2011. They scored 98 goals in the 2010-11 season with Messi getting 53, Villa 23 and Pedro 21. Both attacks had a tendency to come good in the Clasicos with the Henry/Eto’o/Messi strikeforce playing in one of the most famous Real Madrid-Barcelona games of all time in 2009 with Barca winning 6-2 at the Bernabeu and Henry and Messi both scored twice. Messi celebrates with Thierry Henry after Barcelona won the Champions League in 2009. The Argentine congratulates team-mate Samuel Eto'o after he scores in the Champions League final in 2009. The current combination lacks the European Cup the other two have and a big win over Real Madrid but there is still time for them to combine the two with a Clasico final still a possibility. When they first came together at the start of the season there was the fear among Barcelona supporters that the team would not be big enough for the three of them. Barça legend Johan Cruyff had already warned a year early that ‘a ship cannot have two captains’ and that Neymar and Messi would not get on. When Suarez was introduced that was, for some, another reason to believe Luis Enrique would have problems. But nothing could have been further from the truth. Suarez has had his fair share of highly controversial incidents but has never been a bad influence in the dressing room. In Monday’s training session at Barça’s Sports City he received a playful knee between the legs from Neymar in a light-hearted training session ahead of tonight’s game. His relationship with the Brazilian is good; and with Messi’s it’s even better. After a slow start to his Barca career Suarez has now scored 19 goals despite missing the first months of the season through suspension. Messi celebrates with Suarez after the Uruguay international netted against Valencia. Messi never saw eye to eye with David Villa or Ibrahimovic and both were put out at times at having to play second fiddle to the four times Balon d’Or winner but after a season accommodating Daniel Sturridge's preference for playing through the middle, the demands of Messi have not been a problem for Suarez. The training-ground chemistry has been good and has translated on to the pitch. Goals statistics aside Barcelona have always boasted brilliant front threes.

1. **Goals Scored**: The document states that Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are ""just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together,"" which implies they have scored 93 goals (100 - 7 = 93). The summary correctly states that they have scored 93 goals this season. This part is supported.

2. **Historical Goals**: The document mentions that the front three of Henry, Eto'o, and Messi scored a total of 100 goals in the 2008-09 season. The summary also states that Messi, Henry, and Eto'o scored 100 goals in that season. This part is supported.

3. **Champions League Semi-Final**: The summary claims that the trio will attempt to steer Barcelona into the Champions League semi-final and mentions that Luis Enrique's side holds a 3-1 advantage from the quarter-final first leg. However, the document does not provide any information about the Champions League, the current standing in the tournament, or any specific match results. This part of the summary introduces new information that is not supported by the document.

2. It mentions the potential for the trio to achieve significant milestones, including scoring 100 goals together.
3. However, the document does not explicitly mention any upcoming matches or the Champions League semi-final.

Since the highlighted sentence introduces information about the Champions League semi-final that is not supported by the content of the document, it can be classified as a factual hallucination. The document does not provide evidence that the trio is currently attempting to steer Barcelona into the Champions League semi-final.

1. The highlighted sentence states: ""Messi, Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto'o scored 100 goals in the 2008-09 season."" This indicates that the total goals scored by the three players combined is 100.

2. The document provides specific goal counts for each player during that season: Henry scored 26, Eto'o scored 36, and Messi scored 38. When we add these together (26 + 36 + 38), we indeed get 100 goals, confirming the highlighted sentence.

3. However, the isolated statement claims that ""Messi scored 100 goals in the 2008-09 season."" This is incorrect because Messi scored 38 goals, not 100. The 100 goals refer to the combined total of all three players, not just Messi.

Given these points, the summary contains factual hallucinations and is not supported by the document.

Therefore, the response is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the information provided in the document.

1. The document states that Messi, Suarez, and Neymar are ""just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together,"" which indicates they have not yet reached 100 goals.
2. It mentions that if they reach 100 goals, they will match the total scored by Henry, Eto'o, and Messi in 2009, but it does not state that they have already surpassed it.
3. The document does not provide any information about the trio scoring 118 goals or breaking any records for most goals scored in a season by a trio.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence claims that the trio has already broken the record and scored 118 goals, which contradicts the information in the document. Therefore, the highlighted sentence is not supported by the document and is indeed a factual hallucination.

1. The document discusses Barcelona's front three of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar and mentions that they are seven goals short of reaching 100 goals in their first season together. It also compares their potential achievements to the previous record held by Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto'o, and Messi, who scored 100 goals in the 2008-09 season.

2. The summary states that Barcelona's front three have already broken the record for most goals scored in a season by a trio, surpassing the previous record of 100 goals.

3. The isolated statement claims that ""Barcelona's front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar have already broken the record for most goals scored in a season by a trio.""

Now, let's evaluate the isolated statement against the document:

- The document does not support the claim that the current trio has already broken the record; instead, it indicates that they are still seven goals short of reaching 100 goals. Therefore, the isolated statement contradicts the information provided in the document.

429,"The oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties. Researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in Ileret, northwest Kenya, have now found a total of 99 prints. They now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud. The distinct tracks found at Ileret in Kenya (like the one above) are the oldest human footprints in the world. It provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - Homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters. While their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch, hunting parties suggests Homo erectus went after larger prey. Early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Research by Dr Neil Roach has shown that the that the skeletons of Homo erectus had shoulders and collar bones that would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. Dr Neil Roach, a palaeoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York who led the study, said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males. He said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest. Speaking to Nature, Dr Roach said: 'What we can say is that we have a number of individuals, probably males, that are moving across a lake shore in a way that is consistent with how carnivores move. The researchers, who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in San Francisco, hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in Africa. The tracks in Ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at Bournemouth University and Rutgers’ Koobi Fora Field School in Kenya, announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints. This deep print appears to have been left by a male Homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party. Analysis of the print tracks (above) showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do. The prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake. Alongside the human prints were those of birds including storks, pelicans as well as crocodiles, antelope, hippos, bovids and other predators. Professor Matthew Bennett, who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints, is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks. Analysis of the footprints by Professor Matthew Bennett at Bournemouth University revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans, with a pronounced arch and short toes. He concluded that the prints had probably been left by Homo erectus - an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200,000 years ago. They were among the longest surviving of all the human species - surviving for around 1.5 million years. There is some evidence that they may have also been able to control fire and cooked food. Footprints this old are extremely rare as they tend to erode away in a few thousand years, but are also valuable as they can give clues about behaviour. Dr Roach and his colleagues decided to study the prints in more detail in order to get a snapshot of the life led by Homo erectus. Over a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the Ileret sediment have now been uncovered - 99 of which were human. Unlike the grass-eating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone - whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore - the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline. This matched the behaviour of other hunting animals whose prints were also preserved. Previous work by Dr Roach has also shown that Homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter. Homo erectus, shown in the reconstruction above, may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties. Fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully. Dr Roach said: 'There’s starting to be a consensus that around 2 million years ago we see more carnivory that has to do with hunting.' Curtis Marean, a palaeoanthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, said it was hard to tell from the prints exactly what had made them. He told Nature: 'It could be a group hunt, but it could also be lake shore foraging.' Tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution, scientists say. The high-quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children, meaning that human communities grew faster, according to researchers from Lund University in Sweden. The research compared 67 species of mammals, including humans, apes, mice and killer whales, and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning. They found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage, but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores. Eating meat enabled the breast-feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened, according tot he researchers. Among natural fertility societies, the average duration of breast-feeding is 2 years and 4 months. This is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species, around 120 years. It is even less if compared to our closest relatives: female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years, whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years.
","Researchers at the American Museum of Natural History in New York have found 99 footprints that appear to have been left by male Homo erectus.

429,"The oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties. Researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in Ileret, northwest Kenya, have now found a total of 99 prints. They now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud. The distinct tracks found at Ileret in Kenya (like the one above) are the oldest human footprints in the world. It provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - Homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters. While their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch, hunting parties suggests Homo erectus went after larger prey. Early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Research by Dr Neil Roach has shown that the that the skeletons of Homo erectus had shoulders and collar bones that would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. Dr Neil Roach, a palaeoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York who led the study, said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males. He said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest. Speaking to Nature, Dr Roach said: 'What we can say is that we have a number of individuals, probably males, that are moving across a lake shore in a way that is consistent with how carnivores move. The researchers, who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in San Francisco, hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in Africa. The tracks in Ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at Bournemouth University and Rutgers’ Koobi Fora Field School in Kenya, announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints. This deep print appears to have been left by a male Homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party. Analysis of the print tracks (above) showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do. The prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake. Alongside the human prints were those of birds including storks, pelicans as well as crocodiles, antelope, hippos, bovids and other predators. Professor Matthew Bennett, who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints, is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks. Analysis of the footprints by Professor Matthew Bennett at Bournemouth University revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans, with a pronounced arch and short toes. He concluded that the prints had probably been left by Homo erectus - an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200,000 years ago. They were among the longest surviving of all the human species - surviving for around 1.5 million years. There is some evidence that they may have also been able to control fire and cooked food. Footprints this old are extremely rare as they tend to erode away in a few thousand years, but are also valuable as they can give clues about behaviour. Dr Roach and his colleagues decided to study the prints in more detail in order to get a snapshot of the life led by Homo erectus. Over a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the Ileret sediment have now been uncovered - 99 of which were human. Unlike the grass-eating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone - whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore - the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline. This matched the behaviour of other hunting animals whose prints were also preserved. Previous work by Dr Roach has also shown that Homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter. Homo erectus, shown in the reconstruction above, may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties. Fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully. Dr Roach said: 'There’s starting to be a consensus that around 2 million years ago we see more carnivory that has to do with hunting.' Curtis Marean, a palaeoanthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, said it was hard to tell from the prints exactly what had made them. He told Nature: 'It could be a group hunt, but it could also be lake shore foraging.' Tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution, scientists say. The high-quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children, meaning that human communities grew faster, according to researchers from Lund University in Sweden. The research compared 67 species of mammals, including humans, apes, mice and killer whales, and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning. They found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage, but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores. Eating meat enabled the breast-feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened, according tot he researchers. Among natural fertility societies, the average duration of breast-feeding is 2 years and 4 months. This is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species, around 120 years. It is even less if compared to our closest relatives: female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years, whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years.
",,"The oldest human footprints ever recorded were discovered in Kenya, and they indicate that early humans may have been hunters.

This new evidence suggests that early humans were not just scavengers, but capable hunters who could take down large prey.",1,1,1,0,1,"To determine if the summary contains hallucinated content, we need to analyze the document and the summary step-by-step.

1. **Oldest Human Footprints**: The document states that the oldest human footprints were found in Ileret, Kenya, and that they are indeed the oldest human footprints in the world. The summary correctly mentions that the footprints were discovered in Kenya.

2. **Indication of Hunting**: The document discusses how the footprints suggest that Homo erectus were sophisticated hunters, moving in groups, possibly stalking prey. The summary reflects this by stating that the footprints indicate early humans may have been hunters.

3. **Number of Footprints**: The document mentions a total of 99 human prints found, while the summary states ""over 100 early humans have been found."" This is a slight exaggeration, as the number is not accurately represented. This could be considered a factual hallucination since it misrepresents the number of footprints.

4. **Movement as a Hunting Party**: The document supports the idea that the prints were made by groups moving together, which aligns with the summary's claim that they were part of a hunting party.

5. **Scavengers vs. Hunters**: The document states that while early human ancestors may have scavenged, the evidence suggests they were capable hunters. The summary accurately reflects this point.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the number of footprints, as it states ""over 100"" instead of the accurate ""99."" Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document.

1. The document states that a total of 483 prints were uncovered, of which 99 were identified as human prints. This indicates that there were indeed over 100 prints found, but it specifically mentions that 99 of them were human.

2. The document discusses the idea that these prints were made by groups of early humans, suggesting they were part of a hunting party. It mentions that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest, which supports the idea of them moving together as part of a hunting party.

3. The highlighted sentence claims that ""The footprints of over 100 early humans have been found, all moving together as part of a hunting party."" While the document does support the notion of groups of early humans, it does not explicitly state that all 99 human prints were made by early humans moving together as part of a hunting party. The phrase ""all moving together"" could imply a level of certainty that is not fully supported by the document, as it mentions that it could also be lake shore foraging.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains an element that is not fully supported by the document, as it implies a definitive conclusion about the behavior of the early humans that is not explicitly stated.

His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash. The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter, which were later upgraded to negligent homicide. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash. According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his. medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported.

1. **Allegation of Suicide Attempt**: The summary states that Robert Dellinger ""allegedly tried to kill himself in December 2013 by driving across the highway."" The document confirms that Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself when he crashed, so this part of the summary is supported.

The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter, which were later upgraded to negligent homicide. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash. According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his. medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato,. however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a. 'productive and exemplary life.' He. took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks. when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Records show that a Dellinger family trust owns four property in the town of Sunapee worth $3million in total.
",,"Former Fortune 500 executive Robert Dellinger, 54, was sentenced to 12 to 24 years in prison after being found guilty of intentional homicide. Dellinger reportedly drove his pickup truck across a highway at more than 100mph and plowed into an oncoming SUV, killing Amanda Murphy, 24, and her fiance, Jason Timmons, 29, along with their unborn baby. Dellinger insisted he was not suicidal and that he had never been before. Despite this claim, he was found guilty of intentional homicide and will serve a long sentence. Dellinger's wife, Deborah, spoke in court and stated that her husband was a man of high ethics and integrity.",1,1,1,1,1,"The summary contains several inaccuracies and misrepresentations of the information provided in the document. 

1. **Intentional Homicide**: The summary states that Dellinger was found guilty of ""intentional homicide."" However, the document specifies that he pleaded guilty to ""negligent homicide"" and not intentional homicide. This is a significant factual error.

2. **Suicidal Claims**: The summary mentions that Dellinger insisted he was not suicidal and had never been before. While the document does state that he claimed he was not suicidal during his sentencing, it also notes that he had previously told investigators he was trying to kill himself at the time of the crash. This contradiction in the summary could be seen as misleading.

3. **Sentence Duration**: The summary correctly states the sentencing range of 12 to 24 years, which is supported by the document.

4. **Details about the Crash**: The summary accurately describes the crash and the victims, which aligns with the document.

Given these points, the summary contains factual hallucinations regarding the nature of the homicide charge and misrepresents Dellinger's claims about his mental state. Therefore, the summary is not supported by the document.

Final classification: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the information provided in the document.

1. The document states that Robert Dellinger pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the deaths of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, and he faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes. However, it does not mention that he was found guilty of ""intentional homicide."" Instead, the term used is ""negligent homicide.""

2. The highlighted sentence claims that Dellinger was found guilty of intentional homicide, which contradicts the information in the document.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence contradicts the document, which makes it an intrinsic hallucination.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Robert Dellinger was sentenced to 12 to 24 years in prison."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Document Analysis**: The document states that Robert Dellinger faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes. It also mentions that he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, which implies a conviction, but it does not explicitly state that he was sentenced at the time of the document. 

2. **Summary Analysis**: The summary claims that Dellinger was sentenced to 12 to 24 years in prison after being found guilty of intentional homicide. However, the document indicates that he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, not intentional homicide. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may contain an error regarding the nature of the conviction.

3. **Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement ""Robert Dellinger was sentenced to 12 to 24 years in prison."" is a direct claim about the sentencing. While the document indicates that he faces this sentence, it does not confirm that he has been sentenced yet, as the sentencing was still ongoing at the time of the document.

Given these points, the isolated statement cannot be fully supported by the document because it implies a finality (that he has been sentenced) that is not confirmed in the document. Therefore, it is more accurate to classify this statement as [HALLUCINATED] due to the lack of confirmation of the sentencing and the discrepancy regarding the nature of the homicide charge.

The highlighted sentence states that ""Theo Walcott is confident that Arsenal will win the Premier League title next season if they continue their good form."" 

In the document, Walcott expresses optimism about Arsenal's performance, stating that they could lift the title if they had an injury-free season. He mentions that Arsenal has been the ""best team in Europe"" and that the squad's strength and competition for places are positive factors. However, while he expresses hope and belief in their potential, he does not explicitly state that he is ""confident"" they will win the title next season.

The phrase ""if they continue their good form"" aligns with the sentiment in the document, as Walcott discusses the importance of staying fit and maintaining performance. However, the specific wording of ""confident that Arsenal will win"" is not directly supported by a clear statement in the document.

Thus, the highlighted sentence is not directly supported by the document, as it adds a level of certainty (confidence) that is not explicitly stated by Walcott. Therefore, it can be classified as a factual hallucination because it presents a verifiable sentiment (confidence in winning) that is not directly inferable from the document.

While the document does indicate that Walcott is optimistic about Arsenal's chances, it specifically mentions that he believes they could lift the title if they stay fit, rather than outright stating confidence in winning it.

3. **Inference**: The isolated statement does not directly quote Walcott's words from the document. Instead, it interprets his belief as confidence in winning the title, which is a stronger assertion than what is supported by the document. The document suggests a possibility rather than a definitive confidence in winning.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the isolated statement makes a stronger claim than what is supported by the document, it can be classified as a factual hallucination. It implies a level of certainty that is not explicitly stated in the document.

525,"The father one of one three children who were tragically killed in Palm Bay, Florida, in March has spoken out about the kids he cared for and loved. Seven-year-old Lacey McCarty, six-year-old Phillip McCarty and five-month-old Christopher Swist died allegedly at the hands of their mother, Jessica McCarty, in a botched murder-suicide. Christopher Swist - father of the five-month-old and the man who was dating Jessica McCarty just before the alleged killings - had nicknames for all of the children and coached the two oldest in little league baseball. Scroll down for video. Jessica McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Lacey McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself. McCarty was arrested on March 20 and faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incident. Investigators say she left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do' Just 24 hours before their death, he took pictures of the two oldest children at their latest game, and both looked happy as ever, Swist said. 'The kids loved everything about Little League,' Swist told People. 'The past two years, we watched the Little League World Series on ESPN. Our families were always at all the games.' Their love of the sport was so strong that  Palm Bay City Council has renamed a little league field in their town 'Angels' Field' in memory of the children. Swist said that he had a great bond with the children, calling Lacey 'Chick', Christopher 'Toe Toe' and Phillip 'Smash'. As he comes to terms with the tragic deaths of the three kids he loved so much, Swist has created a non-profit organization titled 3 Angels Ball For All, in hopes of helping disadvantaged youth play organizational sports. Jessica McCarty still faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incidents that occurred on March 20. McCarty's partner, Christopher Swist, who she was reportedly on a break with at the time of the alleged murders, coached her two oldest children in little league baseball. Swist, who was only the father of the youngest slain child, said he had a close bond with all three children and gave them all nicknames to go by. Swist called seven-year-old Lacey (right picture, left) 'Chick', five-month-old Christopher (left) 'Toe Toe' and six-year-old Phillip 'Smash' (right). Each nickname supposedly had a story behind it. McCarty was arrested after she called 911 and told police she'd killed her children. Lacey and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children  but lost his fight for life in the days following the attack. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said after the incident. According to Renkens, there had recently been a break in the relationship between McCarty and  Swist. Lacey and Phillip where pronounced dead shortly after they were found unresponsive. Christopher held on for a couple days before dying at the hospital. McCarty was arrested after calling 911 on herself and telling the police she had killed her three children. When Swist arrived on scene - after McCarty had sent him photos of blood throughout the house - and found the children unresponsive. He then called the police. Investigators said McCarty sent photos to Swist of blood throughout the house. Swist arrived first at the scene and found his son unresponsive on his bed, police said. Police said they found a journal in the driveway of the home that was addressed 'To my family,' which indicated that McCarty was sorry for what she 'had to do.' There was also another page addressed to Christopher's father, asking him to keep her son's name alive, police said. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appeared in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the DCF for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the Phillip and Lacey, the two older children McCarty is believed to have killed on March 20. McCarty and Swist had one child together - five-month-old Christopher. Police said they were on a break at the time of the incident. She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Swist also called police when he came home. Swist now has the comfort of his city's support in mourning and remembering the three children he loved. 'All I have left is the memories that my children blessed me with,' Swist told People. 'Those moments will forever be ours together. Those children touched so many lives in the community; naming the field after them is a great way to help keep those memories alive.' And he knows he has to push on and have the strength to hold his memories close. 'I don’t think you ever heal from this,' Swist told Space Coast Daily. He added: 'The best we can do is survive. The way we survive is we all stand together as one family. 'As far as you guys even thinking about naming the field, that really means a lot to us. We just can’t say enough. We miss our kids.

1. **Factual Hallucination**: The summary states that Jessica McCarty was allegedly under the influence of drugs when she killed the children. The document does not mention anything about her being under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident.

2. **Factual Hallucination**: The summary claims that Christopher Swist is the father of all three children. However, the document specifies that he is the father of only the five-month-old Christopher Swist, while Lacey and Phillip are the children of Jessica McCarty and another father.

3. **Non-factual Hallucination**: The summary mentions that Swist created a non-profit organization aimed at helping families battling addiction. The document states that he created a non-profit organization titled ""3 Angels Ball For All,"" which is aimed at helping disadvantaged youth play organizational sports, not specifically focused on families battling addiction.

Given these points, the summary contains hallucinated content. 

Final response: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document for any mention of Jessica McCarty being under the influence of drugs at the time of the killings.

The document provides extensive details about the tragic incident, including the identities of the children, the actions of their mother, Jessica McCarty, and the aftermath of the event. However, it does not mention anything about McCarty being under the influence of drugs when she committed the alleged murders. The only reference to her troubled history is an investigation by the DCF for possible child neglect in 2009, which led to a recommendation for mental health counseling, but there is no indication of drug use at the time of the incident.

Since the highlighted sentence introduces a claim that is not supported by the document, it falls under the category of factual hallucination. The information about McCarty being under the influence of drugs is not inferable from the document.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Christopher Swist is the father of three children."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document states that Christopher Swist is the father of the five-month-old child, Christopher Swist, and mentions that he had a close bond with the two older children, Lacey and Phillip McCarty, who were the children of Jessica McCarty. It is also noted that Swist cared for and loved Lacey and Phillip, even though they were not his biological children.

2. The isolated statement claims that ""Christopher Swist is the father of three children."" This is misleading because while he is the biological father of one child (Christopher), he is not the biological father of Lacey and Phillip, who are the children of Jessica McCarty.

3. Therefore, the isolated statement contradicts the information provided in the document, as it implies that Swist is the father of all three children, which is not accurate.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement contains an intrinsic hallucination because it contradicts the document.

589,"One in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change, scientists claim. The bleak study says animals are most at risk in South America, Australia, and New Zealand. While another group of researchers have added to the forecast with a separate study, which warns that marine animals near North America, Antarctica and New Zealand are most likely to die out. Scientists warn that one in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change and those in South America, Australia, and New Zealand are most at risk. A stock image of an endangered flightless kākāpō parrot, native to New Zealand, is shown. Scientists from the University of Connecticut warned that one in six animals are at risk of extinction, particularly in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem. Dr Mark Urban  studied data from 131 biodiversity studies to come to his bleak conclusions, which are published in the journal, Science. He proposes that the rate of extinction will speed up in line with rising temperatures. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2 per cent. Researchers from the University of Connecticut warned  animals in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem are most at risk. Antarctica, which is home to many species of penguins (stock image) is one of these places. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16 per cent, he said. 'If the world does not come together and control greenhouse gas emissions and we allow the Earth to warm considerably we will face a potential loss of one in six species,' Dr Urban told the BBC. 'Many species will be able to shift their ranges and keep up with climate change whereas others will not either because their habitat has disappeared or because they can't reach their habitat anymore.' If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, the study warns, which could be bad news for endangered jaguars. In a separate study from the University of Berkeley in California, scientists examined extinction rates in fossils over 23 million years. They found that the tropics and Antarctica are most at risk and animals such as whales and dolphins are especially vulnerable. Another study published at the same time has compounded the warning. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and other institutions examined fossils to determine which marine life is most at risk of dying out, based on previous rates of extinction. A study by the University of Connecticut has found that global warming is accelerating the world’s extinctions. One in six species could face extinction due to the effects of climate change if carbon emissions continue at current rates, it warns. Dr Mark Urban from the university came to the conclusion by correlating information from 131 biodiversity studies. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, he said. Animals in small geographic ranges are most at risk - with whales, dolphins and seals proving particularly vulnerable in the past, the study, which is also published in Science, says. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. Comparing these patterns with areas where human activities, such as fishing, impact the oceans revealed areas that may be particularly sensitive. These areas included  regions of the tropics such as the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean, as well as regions such as Antarctica that harbour many unique species. ‘The implications of these patterns for the future of coastal marine ecosystems will depend on how natural risk and current threats interact,’ said co-author Dr Paul Harnik, an assistant professor of geosciences at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ‘By understanding these patterns in the past, we hope to provide a framework for understanding global change.’ The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil types over the past 23 million years. They found that worldwide patterns of extinction remained remarkably similar over the whole period, with the same groups of animals showing similar rates of extinction. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. On the left in this image are fossil examples used, and on the right are living examples, with whales and sharks shown top and bottom respectively. The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil genera over the past 23 million years across a variety of animal groups. The team then compared the 'natural' risk of extinction, based on historic evidence, with current threats from humans and climate change. By combining this ‘natural’ extinction risk with threats from humans and climate change, they created a global map of future hotspots of extinction. ‘Our goal was to diagnose which species are vulnerable in the modern world, using the past as a guide,’ said lead author Dr Seth Finnegan, an assistant professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley. ‘We believe the past can inform the way we plan our conservation efforts. ‘However, there is a lot more work that needs to be done to understand the causes underlying these patterns and their policy implications.’ England will experience a significant increase in the number of record-breaking warm years due to geenhouse gas emissions, scientists have claimed. A study of the Central England Temperature (CET) record, which dates back to 1659, found exceptionally warm years have become 13 times more likely as a result. Shown are the top here are echinoids (sea urchins), and at the bottom are clams. Clams and mussels - so-called bivalves - had about one-tenth the extinction risk of mammals.

'Many species will be able to shift their ranges and keep up with climate change whereas others will not either because their habitat has disappeared or because they can't reach their habitat anymore.' If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, the study warns, which could be bad news for endangered jaguars. In a separate study from the University of Berkeley in California, scientists examined extinction rates in fossils over 23 million years. They found that the tropics and Antarctica are most at risk and animals such as whales and dolphins are especially vulnerable. Another study published at the same time has compounded the warning. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and other institutions examined fossils to determine which marine life is most at risk of dying out, based on previous rates of extinction. A study by the University of Connecticut has found that global warming is accelerating the world’s extinctions. One in six species could face extinction due to the effects of climate change if carbon emissions continue at current rates, it warns. Dr Mark Urban from the university came to the conclusion by correlating information from 131 biodiversity studies. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, he said. Animals in small geographic ranges are most at risk - with whales, dolphins and seals proving particularly vulnerable in the past, the study, which is also published in Science, says. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. Comparing these patterns with areas where human activities, such as fishing, impact the oceans revealed areas that may be particularly sensitive. These areas included  regions of the tropics such as the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean, as well as regions such as Antarctica that harbour many unique species. ‘The implications of these patterns for the future of coastal marine ecosystems will depend on how natural risk and current threats interact,’ said co-author Dr Paul Harnik, an assistant professor of geosciences at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ‘By understanding these patterns in the past, we hope to provide a framework for understanding global change.’ The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil types over the past 23 million years. They found that worldwide patterns of extinction remained remarkably similar over the whole period, with the same groups of animals showing similar rates of extinction. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. On the left in this image are fossil examples used, and on the right are living examples, with whales and sharks shown top and bottom respectively. The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil genera over the past 23 million years across a variety of animal groups. The team then compared the 'natural' risk of extinction, based on historic evidence, with current threats from humans and climate change. By combining this ‘natural’ extinction risk with threats from humans and climate change, they created a global map of future hotspots of extinction. ‘Our goal was to diagnose which species are vulnerable in the modern world, using the past as a guide,’ said lead author Dr Seth Finnegan, an assistant professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley. ‘We believe the past can inform the way we plan our conservation efforts. ‘However, there is a lot more work that needs to be done to understand the causes underlying these patterns and their policy implications.’ England will experience a significant increase in the number of record-breaking warm years due to geenhouse gas emissions, scientists have claimed. A study of the Central England Temperature (CET) record, which dates back to 1659, found exceptionally warm years have become 13 times more likely as a result. Shown are the top here are echinoids (sea urchins), and at the bottom are clams. Clams and mussels - so-called bivalves - had about one-tenth the extinction risk of mammals.

Final response: [SUPPORTED]",0,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and see if the highlighted sentence can be inferred or is directly stated.

The document discusses the impact of climate change on various species, particularly emphasizing that one in every six species could face extinction if no action is taken. It mentions that marine animals, especially in regions like Antarctica and the tropics, are at significant risk due to rising temperatures and other factors. The document also highlights specific vulnerable species, such as whales, dolphins, and seals, and discusses the potential for a large number of marine species to be affected by climate change.

The highlighted sentence states: ""Climate change is threatening marine animals and could potentially kill off a whole range of marine species."" This aligns with the document's assertions about the threats posed by climate change to marine life and the potential for widespread extinction among these species.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [SUPPORTED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Animals in Antarctica are most at risk of extinction."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. The document states that ""animals are most at risk in South America, Australia, and New Zealand"" and also mentions that ""marine animals near North America, Antarctica and New Zealand are most likely to die out."" This indicates that Antarctica is indeed mentioned as a region where animals are at risk.

2. The highlighted sentence from the summary states that ""Animals in the tropics and Antarctica are most at risk of extinction, according to two studies."" This aligns with the information in the document, which supports the idea that animals in Antarctica are at risk.

3. The isolated statement specifically claims that ""Animals in Antarctica are most at risk of extinction."" While the document does indicate that animals in Antarctica are at risk, it does not explicitly state that they are the ""most"" at risk compared to other regions mentioned. Therefore, the isolated statement could be seen as an overreach of the information provided in the document.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement does not contradict the document, but it does make a stronger claim than what is explicitly supported by the text. Thus, it can be classified as a factual hallucination because it implies a level of risk that is not directly supported by the document.

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8. Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.

",,Toni Duggan caused controversy by openly supporting Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal after their victory over Manchester City. The footballer's apology did little to appease outraged City fans.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

   - The summary states that Duggan ""caused controversy by openly supporting"" van Gaal. The document does not explicitly mention that she was ""supporting"" van Gaal; it only states that she posted a photo with him, which led to controversy.

627,"Punched, elbowed, apparently bitten. Just another night for an Atletico Madrid striker. Yet this was not Diego Costa circa 2010 to 2014. This was Mario Mandzukic involved in bust-up after bust-up as he shed blood and sweat against great rivals Real Madrid at the Vicente Calderon. When Atletico allowed Costa to sign for Chelsea on July 1, 2014, Diego Simeone may have fretted about losing his street fighter. Not for long, however. Just nine days later, he bought Mandzukic from Bayern Munich, and the Croatia international looked every bit as aggressive on Tuesday night. Blood pours from Mario Mandzukic's face during the Champions League quarter-final first leg in Madrid. Sergio Ramos and Atletico Madrid striker Mandzukic continually clashed on Tuesday night during the tie. Mandzukic proved he is a warrior with his performance against Real Madrid, just as Diego Costa was. Costa gives John Terry, who is now his Chelsea team-mate, a stern look during a Champions League tie. Nobody elbowed their way to the top quite like Costa – from the streets of Brazil, to Spain, to England – and the same went for Mandzukic in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. The 28-year-old came to blows with defenders Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal  – drawing blood after an elbow to the face from the former, while receiving a punch, and possibly a bite, from the latter. ITV pundit Paul Scholes said Mandzukic 'made a meal of things' yet the evidence was there for all to see, pouring down his face. Round two awaits at the Bernabeu next week. Yet Mandzukic was as culpable as he was the victim. He committed seven fouls, compared to 11 in total by Real Madrid, and it was more than any player has managed in a Champions League game against the winners of La Decima before. The long-ball tactic by Atletico was not working, nor did Mandzukic have enough pace to beat a defence boasting Raphael Varane. He had zero shots on or off target, completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes, and lacked the pace and darting runs Costa delivers. Yet this was about playing rough, rather than scoring goals, and he played the role of warrior to perfection. So much so that Simeone – albeit riskily – substituted his partner, Antoine Griezmann, after 77 minutes instead of the man on thin ice. Mandzukic clashed with Dani Carvajal during the quarter-final first leg and played rough all night. Mandzukic's heat map, who had zero shots on or off target, and completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes. Mandzukic, despite failing to conjure a chance on Tuesday night, is a natural striker. His CV includes Dinamo Zagreb, Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich, and he was imposing at every club. Fifty-six goals in 132 appearances in Croatia's Prva HNL. Fifty-three  in 110  in Germany's Bundesliga. All that added to Simeone feeling Mandzukic was next in line at a forward-thinking club that have a history of great strikers which stretches back decades. No sooner had Fernando Torres left in 2007 for Liverpool, for example, than El Nino was replaced. Sergio Aguero turned up, alongside Diego Forlan, and Torres was old news. Aguero was deemed irreplaceable, until those in Madrid were introduced to Radamel Falcao the same year Kun left. Then, when Falcao left for Monaco in 2013, it was Costa's turn, and so on. Sergio Aguero signed for Atletico in 2006 and scored 74 goals in 175 appearances in La Liga in five years. Radamel Falcao kept up an impressive 0.76 goals-to-game ratio during his time with Atletico from 2011. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink proved a great striker for Atletico as the club produce top forwards continually. No sooner had Fernando Torres left in 2007 for Liverpool than El Nino was replaced at Vicente Caldero. Mandzukic's tattoo on his lower back was on show, and it read: 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' Trouble for the striker is his ink – written in Hebrew – is backwards AND has grammatical mistakes so makes no sense! The Spanish club don't fret losing a striker. They regroup, consider it a temporary inconvenience, and buy a replacement. They have been doing so ever since Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in 1999, and Christian Vieri the year before, and even further still. It's the Atletico way. It is not unlike what has happened with goalkeepers at the club. David de Gea left in 2011 and was replaced by Thibaut Courtois, only for the previously-anonymous Jan Oblak to take over this year. Much like their record with strikers, it looks inspired, as the 22-year-old who cost €16million (£11.5m) thwarted Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez almost single-handedly. And so when Simeone lost Costa to Chelsea, he signed Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic. And if the latter's showing against Real is anything to go by, then the Atletico manager bought just about the closest thing he could find to replace the Barclays Premier League's joint-top goalscorer. Mandzukic and Ramos exchange words during a heated battle between the Madrid rivals on Tuesday night. Mandzukic shows off his battle wounds during the match between the two great Madrid rivals.
","Atletico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid: Read Martin Samuel's report from Spain. Mario Mandzukic was battered and bruised during the quarter-final tie.

Diego Simeone has bought the closest thing to Diego Costa he could find. Mandzukic differs from Costa in style of play but proved as aggressive.

1. **Atletico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid**: The document does not explicitly state the score of the match, but it discusses the match between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. The summary's mention of the score could be considered a factual hallucination since it is not directly supported by the document.

2. **Mario Mandzukic was battered and bruised during the quarter-final tie**: This is supported by the document, which describes Mandzukic being involved in physical altercations and drawing blood.

3. **The Atletico striker came to blows with Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal**: This is also supported by the document, which details Mandzukic's clashes with both players.

4. **Atletico have a history of buying great strikers after selling their forwards**: The document discusses Atletico's history of replacing strikers, which supports this statement.

5. **Diego Simeone has bought the closest thing to Diego Costa he could find**: The document mentions that Simeone bought Mandzukic as a replacement for Costa, which supports this claim.

6. **Mandzukic differs from Costa in style of play but proved as aggressive**: The document indicates that while Mandzukic is aggressive, he lacks the pace and darting runs of Costa, which supports this statement.

7. **He and Antoine Griezmann can become suitable replacements at Atletico**: The document discusses Mandzukic and Griezmann but does not explicitly state that they can become suitable replacements. This could be seen as an inference rather than a direct statement from the document.

Given the analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the score of the match (0-0), which is not supported by the document. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"The highlighted sentence ""Atletico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid: Read Martin Samuel's report from Spain."" is a factual statement that refers to the match result and the author of the report. However, the document does not explicitly state the score of the match (0-0) or mention Martin Samuel as the author of the report. Therefore, this sentence cannot be directly inferred from the document and is not supported by it.

1. **Context from the Document**: The document discusses Mario Mandzukic's performance and his role at Atletico Madrid, especially in comparison to Diego Costa. It mentions that Diego Simeone, the manager, signed Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann as replacements after losing Costa. The document emphasizes that Atletico Madrid has a history of successfully replacing strikers and that Mandzukic, despite his different style from Costa, is seen as a warrior and a capable player.

2. **Analysis of the Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement directly reflects the idea that Mandzukic and Griezmann can serve as suitable replacements for the strikers that Atletico has lost over the years. The document supports this notion by discussing the club's history of replacing forwards and the potential of Mandzukic and Griezmann to fill that role.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the isolated statement can be inferred from the document and aligns with the overall message regarding the capabilities of Mandzukic and Griezmann as replacements at Atletico, it is supported.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [SUPPORTED]."

Martin and Jessica Castillo, from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, lost the ring, which belongs to Mr Castillo, while they were scuba diving during their honeymoon in Playa del Carmen in February 2013, and had all but given up hope of finding it when they were told that it had been found by Massachusetts resident Daniel Roark, who picked it up from the ocean floor over a year after it was first lost. Now, in honor of the lucky reunion with their ring, Mr and Mrs Castillo have renewed their vows - and even asked Mr Roark, 22, to serve as their 'padrino de anillo', or 'godfather of the ring' for the ceremony, which took place in the same town as their original honeymoon.

Joel Aldridge, who recorded the video, told NBC DFW: 'I saw people all over the ground picking things up, and I thought maybe it was wreckage. 'And as they started walking toward me the first guy I saw had a big wad of cash with money sticking out.' Traffic: Cars were forced to veer past the vehicles stopped on the side of the road. Police have also warned anyone caught with the money from the van will be prosecuted. He described how dozens of people vacated their cars and left their doors ajar as they dashed for the cash. 'Everybody else was picking up handfuls and running around, kinda like an Easter egg hunt,' he added.' Jose Rosas, who was searching at the scene, told WFAA: 'We're just trying to make a dollar or two. 'I'm probably going to come back tomorrow and look,' Rosas said. 'I know there's a lot of money out here.' His friend Gage Anderson said they had scoured the road but most of the money had already been picked up.
",,People in Texas were thrilled to find loads of cash on the side of the road after a Brinks truck crashed. The police are currently investigating the incident and are trying to figure out if it was an accident or a heist. Drivers who helped themselves to the money have yet to be arrested.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **""People in Texas were thrilled to find loads of cash on the side of the road after a Brinks truck crashed.""**
   - The document states that money spilled onto the road from a Brinks Armored Truck, but it does not mention a crash. The use of the word ""crashed"" introduces an intrinsic hallucination, as it contradicts the document's information that the door of the truck flew open, not that it crashed.

2. **""The police are currently investigating the incident and are trying to figure out if it was an accident or a heist.""**
   - The document mentions that the Weatherford Police Department is investigating the incident, but it does not suggest that they are trying to determine if it was a heist. This introduces a factual hallucination, as the summary implies a narrative that is not supported by the document.

3. **""Drivers who helped themselves to the money have yet to be arrested.""**
   - The document states that police warned that individuals caught with the money could be prosecuted, implying that arrests could happen. However, the summary's phrasing suggests that no arrests have occurred yet, which is not explicitly supported by the document. This could be seen as a factual hallucination as well.

Given these points, the summary contains both intrinsic and factual hallucinations. Therefore, the correct response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and the highlighted sentence.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document describes an incident where a Brinks Armored Truck's door flew open, causing money to spill onto the road. It details how drivers pulled over to pick up the cash, the police's warnings about the legal implications of keeping the money, and various eyewitness accounts of the scene. However, it does not mention anything about a crash; rather, it states that the door opened while the truck was moving.

2. **Highlighted Sentence**: The highlighted sentence states, ""People in Texas were thrilled to find loads of cash on the side of the road after a Brinks truck crashed."" This sentence implies that there was a crash, which is not supported by the document. The document only mentions that the door of the truck opened, leading to the money spilling out, but does not indicate that there was a crash.

3. **Analysis of Hallucination Types**:
   - **Factual Hallucination**: The sentence introduces the idea of a crash, which is not mentioned in the document.
   - **Non-factual Hallucination**: The sentence does not introduce any non-factual entities.
   - **Intrinsic Hallucination**: The sentence contradicts the document by stating there was a crash when the document does not support that claim.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains an intrinsic hallucination because it contradicts the information provided in the document.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""People in Texas were thrilled to find loads of cash on the side of the road."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document describes an incident where cash spilled from a Brinks Armored Truck on a Texas highway, leading to chaos as drivers stopped to pick up the money. It mentions that some people picked up the cash and that police warned against keeping it. However, it does not explicitly state that people were ""thrilled"" about finding the cash. The document describes people picking up the money and mentions a quote from a person who was searching for cash, but it does not convey any emotional response such as ""thrilled.""

2. **Content of the Summary**: The summary states that ""People in Texas were thrilled to find loads of cash on the side of the road after a Brinks truck crashed."" This suggests a positive emotional reaction to the event, which is not directly supported by the document.

3. **Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement mirrors the summary's claim about people being ""thrilled"" to find cash. Since the document does not provide evidence of this emotional response, the statement cannot be inferred or supported by the document.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement does not have a basis in the document and therefore can be classified as a hallucination.

745,"Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows. Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents’ generation. Scroll down for video. Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows. And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country’s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK’s skin cancer expert: ‘It’s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. ‘It’s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. ‘It’s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. ‘Melanoma is often detected on men’s backs and women’s legs but can appear on any part of the body.’ Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said: ‘Many cases of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are preventable by taking precautions in the sun and making sure you don’t burn. ‘Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don’t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. ‘You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. ‘Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.’ Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: ‘I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. ‘I don’t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. ‘And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. ‘I’ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. ‘I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I’m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. ‘Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.’

764,"Lorenzo Simon was today found guilty of murder after killing his tenant then hacking his body into pieces. A landlord who chopped his friend up and stuffed the body parts into suitcases which he dumped in a canal was today found guilty of murder. Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced victim Michael Spalding, 39, to decorate his flat before attacking him when he refused to work any longer. He then dismembered the handyman using a hacksaw and put Mr Spalding's body parts and tools into two suitcases. Simon, with the help of his girlfriend Michelle Bird, 35, then threw the suitcases into a canal which they weighed down using broken concrete slabs. Today he was found guilty of murder after a jury took 15 hours to decide by unanimous verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. Bird was cleared of murder and manslaughter but admitted assisting an offender following the four-week trial. The court heard Simon murdered Mr Spalding, known as Spud, by stabbing him in the neck at the flat they shared in Smethwick, Birmingham, on April 26 last year. He then hacked the body up and stuffed the head, limbs and tools into a suitcase. Police found his remains when a narrow boat owner spotted one suitcase, containing Mr Spalding's torso, floating in the Birmingham Canal on May 5. It was examined by a Canal Trust contractor on May 12, who opened the case to discover the gruesome evidence. Police divers recovered the second case which contained Mr Spalding's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16. Further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw which was used to saw off Mr Spalding's head. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology experts were able to show a perfect jigsaw fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. The same technique - which provides image resolution 43,000 times more detailed that a hospital CT scan - proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal. A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's grisly remains was discovered 11 days later. Drag marks were also found on the towpath near Pope's Bridge where Simon and Bird dumped the suitcases into the canal. Unemployed Simon, who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and supplying drugs, moved to Derby in a bid to evade police but was arrested with Bird on May 19. He denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the garden and when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum.

Lorenzo Simon has been found guilty of murder and will be sentenced next week.",1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document provided.

1. **Tenant Treatment**: The summary states that Lorenzo Simon made his tenant decorate his flat and treated him like a slave, with a single meal of pizza and chips per day. This is supported by the document, which mentions that Simon exploited Mr. Spalding and provided him with just one meal a day, usually pizza and chips.

2. **Car Crash Accusation**: The summary mentions that after Mr. Spalding was in a car crash, Simon accused him of damaging his VW Passat. The document supports this claim, stating that Simon accused Mr. Spalding of being responsible for damaging his car, which contributed to the fatal attack.

3. **Murder and Dismemberment**: The summary states that Simon stabbed and dismembered Mr. Spalding. This is directly supported by the document, which details how Simon attacked Mr. Spalding and dismembered him using a hacksaw.

4. **Burning of Bones**: The summary claims that Simon burnt Mr. Spalding's bones. However, the document does not mention anything about burning the bones; it only states that parts of a humerus bone were found inside a charred drum. This introduces a factual hallucination, as the act of burning the bones is not supported by the document.

5. **Guilty Verdict**: The summary concludes that Lorenzo Simon has been found guilty of murder and will be sentenced next week. This is supported by the document, which confirms that Simon was found guilty of murder and that sentencing is pending.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the burning of Mr. Spalding's bones, which is not supported by the document. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""He then burnt his bones and threw his parts into the Birmingham Canal."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. **Burning of Bones**: The document mentions that ""when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum,"" which suggests that there was some burning involved, but it does not explicitly state that Simon burnt all of Mr. Spalding's bones. The phrase ""burnt his bones"" implies a more comprehensive action than what is supported by the document.

2. **Throwing Parts into the Birmingham Canal**: The document clearly states that Simon and Bird ""threw the suitcases into a canal,"" which contained Mr. Spalding's body parts. This part of the highlighted sentence is supported by the document.

Given that the highlighted sentence includes the phrase ""burnt his bones,"" which is not explicitly supported by the document, it introduces a factual hallucination. The action of burning is not clearly established in the document, making this part of the sentence unsupported.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence contains hallucinations.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The accusation ultimately led to Simon stabbing Mr. Spalding."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. **Context from the Document**: The document states that Simon accused Mr. Spalding of being responsible for a car accident, which contributed to the tension between them. It mentions that this accusation, combined with Mr. Spalding's complaints about his treatment, led to the fatal attack. However, it does not explicitly state that the accusation alone was the direct cause of the stabbing.

2. **Analysis of the Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement claims that the accusation ""ultimately led to Simon stabbing Mr. Spalding."" While the document implies a connection between the accusation and the stabbing, it does not definitively state that the accusation was the sole or direct cause of the stabbing. The phrasing ""ultimately led to"" suggests a direct causation that is not explicitly supported by the document.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the isolated statement makes a definitive claim about causation that is not directly supported by the evidence in the document, it can be classified as a factual hallucination. The document provides context for the events but does not confirm that the accusation was the direct cause of the stabbing.

The 18-carat gold rectangular piece was a gift to Lord Uxbridge, whose stoic exchange with the Duke of Wellington after losing his leg to a cannonball has become etched in history. In a famous example of the British stiff upper lip, after realising he was gravely wounded Uxbridge turned to the British military commander and said 'by God, sir, I've lost my leg', to which Wellington replied 'by God, sir, so you have!' Auctioned: This gold trinket box, presented to Lord Uxbridge for his heroics in The Battle of Waterloo, was sold to a private collector for more than £100,000. His leg was buried near the battlefield but later dug up and used as a macabre tourist attraction. The gold Irish Freedom Box was given to the aristocrat, who was by then Marquess of Anglesey, in 1828 by Trinity College Dublin when he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The top has a finely embossed coat of arms with a frame of rocaille shells and foliage around it and the base has another coat of arms with a similar border. The cover coat of arms is Lord Uxbridge's, otherwise known as Field Marshal Henry William Paget. The coat of arms on the base is that of Trinity College Dublin. Famed for losing his leg: Lord Uxbrige commanded 13,000 Allied cavalry and 44 guns of horse artillery at the Battle of Waterloo. Piece of history: The 18-carat gold Irish Freedom Box was given to the aristocrat, who was by then Marquess of Anglesey, in 1828 by Trinity College Dublin when he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The box is about three-and-a-half inches long and weighs just six ounces. It was sold by Bonhams to a private collector for £100,900. Jon Baddeley, managing director at Bonhams Knightsbridge, said: 'The battle of Waterloo was one of the most significant military encounters of the 19th century and the outcome had a profound effect on the future of Europe so not surprisingly there was a lot of public interest is this sale and the bidding from collectors was fierce.' Lord Uxbrige commanded 13,000 Allied cavalry and 44 guns of horse artillery at the Battle of Waterloo. At around 2:30pm, at a crucial stage in the battle, he led a charge of the 2,000 heavy cavalry of the Household Brigade and the Union Brigade to push back the French. The charge succeeded in sweeping the French infantry away but Lord Uxbridge was unable to rally his troops, who ran on in pursuit and were cut up by counter-attacking French cavalry. First ever prosthetic leg: When Uxbridge lost his leg he is said to have stoically remarked 'by God, sir, I've lost my leg'. This wooden limb, the firtst ever articulated wooden limb, was designed for him and remains in the Cavalry Museum at Plas Newydd, on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales. He spent the rest of the battle leading a series of charges by British light cavalry formations, and had eight or nine horses shot from under him. One of the last cannon shots fired on June 18 1815 hit his right leg - requiring it to be amputated above the knee. After being wounded, Lord Uxbridge was transported to his headquarters in the village of Waterloo. The remains of his leg were removed by surgeons - without antiseptic or anaesthetics. Bloody encounter: A painting of the Battle of Waterloo by William Holmes Sullivan. Another famous anecdote records the officer as saying 'the knives appear somewhat blunt' as he underwent the horrendous procedure. In recognition of his gallantry, the Prince Regent created him Marquess of Anglesey and made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath five days after the battle. On the one day of fighting at the Battle of Waterloo there were close to 55,000 either killed, wounded, or missing in action from both sides. The staggering density of the injured men - around 2,291 per mile on the front line - compared with 234 over the same area on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 - meant that a huge number were left to bleed to death on the battlefield.

1. **Gift of the Gold Trinket Box**: The document states that an 18-carat gold trinket box was indeed presented to Lord Uxbridge, which is accurately reflected in the summary.

2. **Famous Figure in the Battle of Waterloo**: The summary correctly identifies Lord Uxbridge as a famous figure in the Battle of Waterloo, which is supported by the document.

3. **Auction Sale Price**: The document mentions that the trinket box was sold for £100,900, which matches the summary.

4. **Macabre Tourist Attraction**: The summary states that Lord Uxbridge's leg was used as a macabre tourist attraction. The document mentions that his leg was buried near the battlefield and later dug up, but it does not explicitly state that it was used as a tourist attraction. This could be considered a factual hallucination, as it is not directly supported by the document.

5. **Prosthetic Leg in the Cavalry Museum**: The summary claims that Lord Uxbridge's wooden prosthetic leg can be viewed in the Cavalry Museum at Plas Newydd, which is supported by the document.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the use of Lord Uxbridge's leg as a macabre tourist attraction, which is not explicitly stated in the document.

2. **""a famous figure in the Battle of Waterloo""**: This is also supported, as the document describes Lord Uxbridge as an officer who commanded cavalry at the Battle of Waterloo and is noted for losing his leg during the battle.

3. **""and later used as a macabre tourist attraction""**: This part of the highlighted sentence is problematic. The document mentions that Lord Uxbridge's leg was buried near the battlefield and later dug up and used as a macabre tourist attraction, but it does not state that the gold trinket box itself was used in this way. The highlighted sentence implies that the trinket box was used as a tourist attraction, which is not supported by the document.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains a factual hallucination regarding the use of the trinket box as a tourist attraction. Therefore, the highlighted sentence is:

1. **Dug the pug was bitten by a rattlesnake while hiking**: This is directly supported by the document, which states that Dug was bitten while hiking with his owner.

2. **miraculously survived**: The document mentions that Dug made a miraculous recovery, so this is also supported.

3. **His owner rushed him to the hospital**: The document states that Lindsay rushed Dug to the California Veterinary Specialist Hospital for treatment, which supports this part of the summary.

4. **where he was given two vials of venom antidote**: The document specifies that Dug was given ""an entire vile of venom antidote,"" not two vials. This introduces a factual hallucination since the summary inaccurately states the quantity of the antidote.

5. **and treated for a week**: The document mentions that Dug was treated for two days, not a week. This is another factual hallucination.

6. **The two are now back at home and enjoying their hikes again**: The document implies that Dug is ready to go home, but it does not confirm that they are enjoying hikes again. This part of the summary is not directly supported by the document.

Based on the analysis, the summary contains factual hallucinations regarding the number of vials of antidote and the duration of treatment, as well as an unsupported claim about enjoying hikes again.

Therefore, the summary contains hallucinated content. 

Final response: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the information provided in the document.

1. The document states that Dug the pug was bitten by a rattlesnake and that he was taken to California Veterinary Specialist Hospital in Ontario for treatment.
2. It mentions that he was given ""an entire vile of venom antidote"" (note: ""vile"" should be ""vial"") and that he received ""two days of round-the-clock IV fluid and treatment.""
3. The document does not specify that he was treated for a week; it only mentions the two days of treatment.

Now, let's break down the highlighted sentence:
- ""His owner rushed him to the hospital"" - This is supported by the document.
- ""where he was given two vials of venom antidote"" - This is not supported; the document states he was given ""an entire vile of venom antidote,"" not two vials.
- ""and treated for a week"" - This is also not supported; the document only mentions two days of treatment.

Since the highlighted sentence contains inaccuracies regarding the number of vials and the duration of treatment, it does not accurately reflect the information in the document. Therefore, it can be classified as a factual hallucination.

Final classification: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""He was given two vials of venom antidote."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document states that Dug was given ""an entire vile of venom antidote."" This indicates that he received some amount of antidote, but it does not specify the number of vials. The term ""vile"" appears to be a typographical error for ""vial,"" but it is singular, suggesting he received one vial, not two.

2. The isolated statement claims that he was given ""two vials of venom antidote."" This contradicts the information in the document, which only mentions one vial.

Since the isolated statement contradicts the document, it falls under the category of intrinsic hallucinations.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

The incident has caused widespread panic and no one has been able to confirm the exact number of injuries or casualties yet.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **Location and Event**: The summary mentions a college campus in Michigan and a fire on April Fool's Day, which aligns with the document. However, the document does not mention an explosion or a ""massive fire,"" but rather a fire caused by a firework prank.

2. **Cause of Fire**: The summary states that the fire was started by a ""homemade bomb."" This is a significant deviation from the document, which clearly states that the fire was caused by a lit firework thrown by one of the residents. This is a factual hallucination, as it introduces a new cause (homemade bomb) that is not supported by the document.

3. **Panic and Casualties**: The summary claims there was ""widespread panic"" and mentions injuries or casualties that have not been confirmed. The document explicitly states that ""no one was hurt,"" contradicting the summary's implication of injuries. This is an intrinsic hallucination, as it contradicts the information in the document.

2. **Highlighted Sentence**: The highlighted sentence states that ""A college campus in Michigan was engulfed by a massive fire following a horrific explosion on April Fool's Day."" This implies a much larger and more dangerous situation than what is described in the document. The use of ""massive fire"" and ""horrific explosion"" suggests a level of severity and type of incident that is not supported by the document.

3. **Classification**: The highlighted sentence introduces elements (massive fire, horrific explosion) that are not present in the document. Therefore, it does not accurately reflect the information provided and contradicts the nature of the incident as described.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""A college campus in Michigan was engulfed by a massive fire."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document describes an incident where a fire occurred at an apartment near Grand Valley State University in Michigan due to an April Fools prank involving fireworks. 
2. It mentions that the fire was significant enough to require multiple fire department units and that the building was evacuated.
3. However, the document does not mention an explosion or that the fire engulfed the entire college campus; it specifically refers to an apartment building.

Now, let's evaluate the isolated statement:
- The statement claims that a ""college campus in Michigan was engulfed by a massive fire."" 
- The document does not support the idea that the entire campus was engulfed; it only discusses a fire at an apartment building near the campus.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement contains a factual hallucination because it inaccurately represents the scope of the fire as affecting the entire campus rather than just the apartment building.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

837,"A prolific gang of thieves who carried out early morning raids on multi-million pound mansions to steal cash, jewellery and luxury cars  have been jailed for a total of 17 years. Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah treated burglary 'like a job, a profession,' raiding houses in affluent west London, Herfordshire and Surrey. Over the course of 11 months the gang broke into 21 homes, taking a Ferrari, Porches, Minis, paintings and cash worth £1million, often waiting until home owners were on holiday before striking. Sayed Juied, 32, and Sadek Miah, 31,  were jailed for six years each after admitting to raiding 21 muti-million pound homes in west London, Hertfordshire and Surrey. The gang were undeterred by security systems, officers said, instead viewing them as a sign a property was worth raiding. If they found that valuables were locked in a safe inside, they would simply cut the safe out, before cracking it open later. Officers first began hunting the group in July last year after a raid on a £2.6million house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, next door to the Lawn Tennis Association. Mohammed Alam, 26, was give five years. Police said the gang treated robbery as 'a profession', surveying properties before they struck. The raiders smashed in a back window before ransacking the property, taking keys to a £30,000 Porsche Cayenne and a £20,000 Mini Cooper, along with £13,000 of jewellery and electrical items. The house was so badly damaged the owners also had to foot a £13,000 repair bill. A week later the gang struck two neighbouring homesin Putney, including one £4.6million house, taking jewellery worth £38,700, and a Porsche Cayenne worth £75,000. Continuing their all-night burglary spree, they hit another Putney home  where they stole a personalised Ferrari worth £280,000, a matching Cayenne worth £130,000, and a painting worth nearly £50,000. Jewellery worth £8,600 was taken along with £1,400 in foreign notes was taken from a house in Kingston Hill during another raid in July. In another burglary in Kingston Hill last July, the back patio doors were forced open while the homeowners were away and the alarm system was smashed. Jewellery worth £8,600 was taken along with £1,400 in foreign currency. Three homes in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, were targeted between December 2013 and July last year, with damage caused to front doors and property worth £500 taken during one raid. Police tracked the trio after staff at the All England Club, home to the Wimbledon tennis championships, caught their car on CCTV. They passed the details to the Metropolitan Police, who found that the car had been rented by Alam, 26, from Unxbridge, who had used his real name. That in turn led them to Juied, 32, and Miah, 31, both from Maida Vale, west London. When police arrested the trio they found multiple Google searches on their computers on how to disable alarm systems and CCTV, and how to crack open safes. The gang took cars, cash, jewellery, electricals and paintings worth a total of £1million over the course of 11 months. Among their haul were two Porche Cayennes (pictured) worth a total of £205,000. During one raid at a £2.6million opposite the All England Lawn Tennis Association in Wimbledon, the raiders made off with a £20,000 Mini Cooper (pictured) along with a Porsche, cash and jewels. The gang admitted conspiring to commit the burglaries, and were jailed for a total of 17 years at Kingston Crown Court on Wednesday. Alam was given five years behind bars, while Juied and Miah were both given six-year prison terms. Detective Sergeant Dan Mitchell, from Merton burglary team, said: 'They would conduct reconnaissance on big detached houses in really affluent neighbourhoods and then break in.

4. **Took Ferrari, Porches, art and jewels worth a total of £1million in 11 months**: The document confirms that the gang stole various luxury items, including a Ferrari and Porsches, and that the total value of their haul was £1 million over 11 months. This is supported.

5. **Were jailed at Kingston Crown Court after admitting burglary offences**: The document states that the gang was jailed for a total of 17 years at Kingston Crown Court after admitting to the burglaries. This is also supported.

1. The document states that ""A prolific gang of thieves... raided houses in affluent west London, Herfordshire and Surrey. Over the course of 11 months the gang broke into 21 homes..."" This indicates that the total number of homes raided by the gang is 21.

2. The summary also reflects this information, stating that ""Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah raided a total of 21 homes.""

3. However, the isolated statement specifically attributes the raiding of all 21 homes solely to Mohammed Alam. The document does not support the claim that Alam alone raided all 21 homes; it states that the gang as a whole raided these homes.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement misrepresents the information in the document by implying that only Mohammed Alam was responsible for raiding all 21 homes, which contradicts the collective nature of the gang's actions.

839,"The attorney for an Arizona city where 19 firefighters died  while battling a massive woodland blaze says he was told it was an order from the group's supervisor led to their deaths in June 2013. Prescott City Attorney Jon Paladini claims the fire's sole survivor, lookout Brendan McDonough, heard the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots order the crew to leave a safe spot where the fire had already burned. Paladini tells the Arizona Republic that he was told the order came just before winds whipped Yarnell Hill into a deadly, all encompassing firestorm. Fatal orders? The Yarnell Hill Fire killed 19 firefighters in 2013, the worst disaster of its kind since 1933. New revelations now claim their deaths came after their supervisor gave orders for the crew to leave a safe zone. But first, Paladini claims McDonough heard crew supervisor Eric Marsh and his top deputy arguing over making the dangerous move. Marsh ordered it, Paladini says, while his deputy Jesse Steed warned against it. Whether or not Paladini's claim is true, neither man is alive to verify it. What's more, Paladini's claim is based on what he says he was told by Darrell Willis, former chief of woodland fires for the city. Paladini says McDonough told Willis about the deadly decision. But neither Willis nor McDonough will verify that account. McDonough told the Arizona Republic when asked about the radio interaction he allegedly heard between Marsh and Steed: 'I think you're being misinformed.' Prescott, Arizona City Attorney Jon Paladini (left) claims that the lone surviving Granite Mountain Hotshot Brendan McDonough overheard an argument between the crew leader and his deputy over the move, which would prove deadly. Former Prescott Fire Division Chief Darrell Willis, seen here speaking during a memorial service honoring the 19 fallen firefighters, says McDonough came to him to get something 'off his shoulders.' Willis won't say what that was, but both he and McDonough have denied it was a recounting of any argument between crew chief Eric Marsh and his deputy Jesse Steed. And when the paper asked Willis about the argument, Willis said: 'That was not part of the detail that I knew — that he told me.' Paladini says that's a departure from what Willis previously told him. Paladini told the Arizona Republic, in part:. 'McDonough allegedly overheard radio traffic between Marsh and Steed... 'Marsh told Steed to leave the 'black,' which was safe... 'Steed protested, saying the move would be dangerous... 'That is what Darrell (Willis) told me,' Paladini said. Despite his claim that Paladini got the facts of their conversation wrong, Willis does not deny speaking to the attorney. Willis says he did so after McDonough came to him because he 'wanted to get something off his shoulders.' Willis, evidently, just isn't saying what that something was. The members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots (pictured) were engulfed by wind-whipped flames on the third day of a lightning-sparked blaze that destroyed scores of homes and charred 8,400 acres in and around the tiny town of Yarnell, northwest of Phoenix. The June 30 disaster marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933, when more than two dozen firefighters were killed battling the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, the Arizona Republic writes, 'when Willis reported the conversation to Paladini and others, it set off a chain reaction of legal actions beginning with reports to the Arizona State Forestry Division, the Prescott City Council and the Arizona Attorney General's Office. It also led authorities to interview other potential witnesses, and prompted an unsuccessful effort to subpoena McDonough.' The purported revelation may change the outcome of a wrongful death suit filed by the families of a dozen on the hotshots last June accusing the state of negligence. It could also change the outcome of suits filed by dozens more area property owners suing the state for alleged mismanagement that led to the destruction of their property. The Forestry Division's liability might be reduced if it turns out Marsh overruled Steed's concerns over moving out of the 'black' safe zone.

The highlighted sentence states: ""Paladini claims McDonough told his secret to former city fire chief Darrell Willis.""

In the document, it is mentioned that ""Willis says McDonough came to him to get something 'off his shoulders.'"" This indicates that McDonough did approach Willis, which supports the idea that there was some communication between them. However, the document also states that ""Willis won't say what that was,"" and that both he and McDonough have denied it was a recounting of any argument between crew chief Eric Marsh and his deputy Jesse Steed. 

While Paladini claims that McDonough told Willis about the deadly decision, the document indicates that this claim is not verified and is disputed by both Willis and McDonough. Therefore, the assertion that McDonough told his ""secret"" to Willis is not definitively supported by the document, as it lacks confirmation and is contradicted by the denials from both parties.

New revelations now claim their deaths came after their supervisor gave orders for the crew to leave a safe zone. But first, Paladini claims McDonough heard crew supervisor Eric Marsh and his top deputy arguing over making the dangerous move. Marsh ordered it, Paladini says, while his deputy Jesse Steed warned against it. Whether or not Paladini's claim is true, neither man is alive to verify it. What's more, Paladini's claim is based on what he says he was told by Darrell Willis, former chief of woodland fires for the city. Paladini says McDonough told Willis about the deadly decision. But neither Willis nor McDonough will verify that account. McDonough told the Arizona Republic when asked about the radio interaction he allegedly heard between Marsh and Steed: 'I think you're being misinformed.' Prescott, Arizona City Attorney Jon Paladini (left) claims that the lone surviving Granite Mountain Hotshot Brendan McDonough overheard an argument between the crew leader and his deputy over the move, which would prove deadly. Former Prescott Fire Division Chief Darrell Willis, seen here speaking during a memorial service honoring the 19 fallen firefighters, says McDonough came to him to get something 'off his shoulders.' Willis won't say what that was, but both he and McDonough have denied it was a recounting of any argument between crew chief Eric Marsh and his deputy Jesse Steed. And when the paper asked Willis about the argument, Willis said: 'That was not part of the detail that I knew — that he told me.' Paladini says that's a departure from what Willis previously told him. Paladini told the Arizona Republic, in part:. 'McDonough allegedly overheard radio traffic between Marsh and Steed... 'Marsh told Steed to leave the 'black,' which was safe... 'Steed protested, saying the move would be dangerous... 'That is what Darrell (Willis) told me,' Paladini said. Despite his claim that Paladini got the facts of their conversation wrong, Willis does not deny speaking to the attorney. Willis says he did so after McDonough came to him because he 'wanted to get something off his shoulders.' Willis, evidently, just isn't saying what that something was. The members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots (pictured) were engulfed by wind-whipped flames on the third day of a lightning-sparked blaze that destroyed scores of homes and charred 8,400 acres in and around the tiny town of Yarnell, northwest of Phoenix. The June 30 disaster marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933, when more than two dozen firefighters were killed battling the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, the Arizona Republic writes, 'when Willis reported the conversation to Paladini and others, it set off a chain reaction of legal actions beginning with reports to the Arizona State Forestry Division, the Prescott City Council and the Arizona Attorney General's Office. It also led authorities to interview other potential witnesses, and prompted an unsuccessful effort to subpoena McDonough.' The purported revelation may change the outcome of a wrongful death suit filed by the families of a dozen on the hotshots last June accusing the state of negligence. It could also change the outcome of suits filed by dozens more area property owners suing the state for alleged mismanagement that led to the destruction of their property. The Forestry Division's liability might be reduced if it turns out Marsh overruled Steed's concerns over moving out of the 'black' safe zone.

909,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, a former top deputy to Saddam Hussein and more recently a key figure in Sunni extremist groups battling the Iraqi government, has been killed in a security operation in that country, Iraqi state-run television reported Friday. Al-Douri was the highest-ranking member of Hussein's regime to evade capture -- the ""King of Clubs"" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops to identify the most-wanted regime officials. He also was a man thought to have led the post-Hussein Sunni extremist group Naqshbandi Army. Military analysis website Globalsecurity.org says the Naqshbandi Army supports ISIS, which has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. Al-Douri was killed in an operation by Iraqi security forces and Shia militia members in the Hamrin Mountains between Tikrit and Kirkuk, Iraq, Shia militia commander Hadi al-Ameri said. That militia is a predominantly Shiite fighting group that worked with Iraqi troops earlier this month to liberate the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS. The death of al-Douri was also reported by the governor of Salahuddin province, Raid al-Jubouri, who spoke by phone on Iraqi television. Al-Douri's body arrived Friday in Baghdad, where DNA samples were taken to confirm the identity, said the spokesman of another Shiite militia called Hashd Shaabi in an interview with state-run Iraqiya TV. DNA test results could be available in 48 hours, Hashd Shaabi spokesman Yousuf al-Kilabi told the outlet. The U.S. military is aware of the media reports but doesn't have further information to evaluate them, said Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command. While officials are aware of al-Douri's role in the Hussein regime, Ryder declined to comment about whether the United States or the coalition was targeting any specific individuals. Al-Douri was a military commander and vice chairman of the country's revolutionary command council in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime -- effectively Hussein's No. 2 man. Hussein's regime fell during a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The U.S. military had said that after the Iraqi leader's fall, al-Douri helped finance a Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed.

Al-Douri saluted troops from the reviewing stand as they marched by. Then, just days before the U.S. invasion, al-Douri addressed an emergency summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to discuss ultimately unsuccessful ways to avert the war. Al-Douri accused the United States of aggression and blamed Kuwait for his country's suffering, calling leaders of the neighboring Gulf state ""traitors"" for cooperating with the United States and Israel. That comment prompted the Kuwaiti representative to stand up and protest, to which al-Douri countered, ""Shut up, sit down you small agent [of the U.S.], you monkey!"" Kuwaiti television cut away from the heated exchange and rejoined the conference later. Al-Douri's efforts were all in vain. The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, ousting Hussein, al-Douri and the entire regime. In subsequent years, several claims asserted that al-Douri was either killed or captured during the war and its aftermath. At the same time, a man claiming to be al-Douri released a number of audio messages over the years taunting Iraqi and U.S. officials. In 2012, a series of videos appeared online purporting to show al-Douri deriding the Shiite-led government that took over Iraq after Hussein's ouster. CNN couldn't independently verify the authenticity of those videos on YouTube or the identity of the man speaking, though he bore a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claimed to be al-Douri wore an olive military uniform and sat behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derided Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he described as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, ""has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital."" At that time, nine years had passed since the invasion and, al-Douri claimed that Iraq was still in peril. ""Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country,"" he said.

909,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, a former top deputy to Saddam Hussein and more recently a key figure in Sunni extremist groups battling the Iraqi government, has been killed in a security operation in that country, Iraqi state-run television reported Friday. Al-Douri was the highest-ranking member of Hussein's regime to evade capture -- the ""King of Clubs"" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops to identify the most-wanted regime officials. He also was a man thought to have led the post-Hussein Sunni extremist group Naqshbandi Army. Military analysis website Globalsecurity.org says the Naqshbandi Army supports ISIS, which has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. Al-Douri was killed in an operation by Iraqi security forces and Shia militia members in the Hamrin Mountains between Tikrit and Kirkuk, Iraq, Shia militia commander Hadi al-Ameri said. That militia is a predominantly Shiite fighting group that worked with Iraqi troops earlier this month to liberate the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS. The death of al-Douri was also reported by the governor of Salahuddin province, Raid al-Jubouri, who spoke by phone on Iraqi television. Al-Douri's body arrived Friday in Baghdad, where DNA samples were taken to confirm the identity, said the spokesman of another Shiite militia called Hashd Shaabi in an interview with state-run Iraqiya TV. DNA test results could be available in 48 hours, Hashd Shaabi spokesman Yousuf al-Kilabi told the outlet. The U.S. military is aware of the media reports but doesn't have further information to evaluate them, said Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command. While officials are aware of al-Douri's role in the Hussein regime, Ryder declined to comment about whether the United States or the coalition was targeting any specific individuals. Al-Douri was a military commander and vice chairman of the country's revolutionary command council in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime -- effectively Hussein's No. 2 man. Hussein's regime fell during a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The U.S. military had said that after the Iraqi leader's fall, al-Douri helped finance a Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed. A month before the invasion, al-Douri presided over a military parade in Mosul, an event covered by CNN, and his participation became one of the last times he was seen in public, covered by CNN. Al-Douri saluted troops from the reviewing stand as they marched by.

952,"Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have successfully ousted ISIS from the nation's largest oil refinery, the coalition said Sunday. Iraqi security forces regained full control of the Baiji refinery, the Combined Joint Task Force said. A week ago, ISIS claimed it controlled part of the facility, posting images online that purported to back up the claim. Iraq is working to fortify the facility's defenses, the task force said in a statement. Over the past nine days, the coalition conducted 47 airstrikes in the area, the statement said. Meanwhile, Peshmerga forces -- also with the assistance of coalition strikes -- cleared 84 square kilometers (32 square miles) of ISIS-occupied territory in Iraq on Saturday, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said. The Peshmerga are the national military force of Kurdistan. ""Front-line reporting indicates at least 35 ISIS terrorists were killed during the offensive,"" the council said in a statement. The goal was to push back ISIS and ""diminish its ability to threaten the security of Kirkuk province,"" the statement said. ""This success follows an offensive south and west of Kirkuk"" last month in which 100 square kilometers (39 square miles) of terrain was cleared, the council said.

The document does not support the idea that ISIS has been entirely eliminated; it only indicates that certain areas have been cleared and that there have been military successes against ISIS.

1. **Deion Sanders Jr. caused controversy on social media when he demanded hood doughnuts**: The document mentions that Deion Sanders Jr. tweeted about wanting ""hood doughnuts,"" but it does not explicitly state that this caused controversy. The term ""controversy"" is not supported by the document, which focuses more on the playful interaction between father and son.

2. **leading his father, Deion Sanders, to criticize him for his ""bad taste""**: The document describes Deion Sanders responding to his son's tweet in a joking manner, but it does not explicitly label this as a ""criticism"" or refer to it as ""bad taste."" This interpretation could be seen as a stretch.

3. **The former football and baseball star and current analyst is said to be worth around $40million and is known for his extravagant lifestyle**: This part is supported by the document, which states that Deion Sanders is worth around $40 million and mentions his luxury clothing items.

4. **Sanders Jr. was quick to defend himself, stating that he still loved the ""hood's doughnuts""**: This is supported by the document, as it mentions that Sanders Jr. responded to his father by saying he still loves the ""hood's doughnuts.""

5. **The argument caused a stir among fans and observers, with some questioning the Sanders family's sense of humor**: The document does not mention any stir among fans or observers or any questioning of the Sanders family's sense of humor. This is an addition that is not supported by the text.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains elements that are not directly supported by the document, particularly the claims of controversy and the stir among fans. Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document in relation to the highlighted sentence.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document describes an interaction between Deion Sanders Jr. and his father, Deion Sanders, on social media. It mentions that Deion Jr. tweeted about wanting ""hood doughnuts,"" and his father responded with a humorous critique regarding his son's lifestyle and taste. The document also indicates that the exchange was light-hearted and that both parties expressed love for each other despite the teasing.

2. **Highlighted Sentence Analysis**: The highlighted sentence states that Deion Sanders Jr. ""caused controversy on social media when he demanded hood doughnuts,"" and that this led to his father criticizing him for his ""bad taste."" 

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The phrase ""caused controversy"" is somewhat subjective. While the document mentions that the interaction was noted on social media, it does not explicitly state that it caused controversy. However, it does imply that there was a reaction from fans and observers.
   - The term ""demanded"" is also a stronger word than what is presented in the document. Deion Jr. expressed a desire for ""hood doughnuts,"" but it was not framed as a demand in the document.
   - The document does indicate that Deion Sanders criticized his son, but it was in a humorous context rather than a serious critique of ""bad taste.""

Given these points, the highlighted sentence contains elements that are not fully supported by the document. The use of ""controversy"" and ""demanded"" introduces a level of interpretation that is not directly supported by the text.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The argument caused a stir among fans and observers."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document discusses a social media interaction between Deion Sanders Jr. and his father, Deion Sanders, regarding a tweet about ""hood doughnuts.""
2. It mentions that the interaction was light-hearted and included humor, but it does not explicitly state that it caused a stir among fans and observers.
3. The summary suggests that the argument did cause a stir, but the document itself does not provide evidence or details to support this claim.

Since the document does not provide any information that directly supports the isolated statement about the argument causing a stir among fans and observers, we can conclude that the statement is not supported by the document.

Details of the doctors' brutal murders in the northern Iraqi desert were reported by the country's Al-Sumaria satellite television network. Local official Mowaffaq Hamid al-Azawi described the city of Mosul as a big open-air prison, where residents are subjected to barbaric torture at the hands of the ISIS terrorists. The news comes as the jihadis reportedly executed 60 Sunni tribal fighters in Iraq's Anbar province. Members of the Al-Karableh, Albu Ubaid, Albu Mahal and Albu Salman tribes were brutally executed after paranoid ISIS militants accused them of collaborating with the Iraqi security forces. Iraqi Army soldiers and the Iran-backed volunteer Shiite militias allied with the Iraqi regime have had great success in pushing ISIS out of key towns and villages recently.

The militants have also targeted Iraq's indigenous religious minorities, including Christians and followers of the ancient Yazidi faith, forcing tens of thousands from their homes. Since then, ISIS has carved out a self-styled caliphate in the large area straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border that it now controls. In early August, the United States launched airstrikes on the militant group in Iraq, in an effort to help Iraqi forces fight back against the growing threat by the IS militants, who still hold the northern Iraqi province of Ninevah and most of the western province of Anbar, in addition to small areas north of Baghdad in their hands, along with a large swath of land in neighboring Syria.

993,"Zoe Hadley, also known as Zoe Hommel, who hanged herself in a hotel room after suffering a mystery illness. The teenage daughter of a leading solicitor hanged herself in a hotel room after years of suffering a mystery illness that left her unable to eat, walk or open her eyes for long periods, an inquest has heard. Zoe Hadley, 19, also known as Zoe Hommel, had been battling an undiagnosed illness since the age of 13 and was found dead at a hotel in Putney, south west London last year. An inquest at Westminster Coroners Court heard how her parents, solicitor Lisa Hommel and her GP father Laurence, struggled to treat her condition. The inquest heard how doctors could find no physical cause for her illness and that the teenager refused to accept she had mental health problems. She insisted on having a series of operations, including the removal of her healthy appendix and accused her father of conspiring to fake an operation to make her believe she'd had a surgery for a prolapse. The inquest also heard that Miss Hadley suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk. After her death, notes she had written saying she was 'tormented by voices' indicating she might have been suffering from schizophrenia, the hearing was told. A statement read to the hearing on behalf of her father, Dr Hommel, described how he and his wife fought to cope with their daughter’s illness and their vain attempts to help her. He said: 'She was a beautiful, intelligent, loving daughter. 'Up until the age of 13 she excelled at school. In 2009 she started to suffer terrible headaches and no physical causes were found. 'She was not eating, drinking or opening her eyes. It took her three months of treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital to open her eyes and look at us, four months to eat solid food, six months before she could get into a wheelchair. The cause of the illness was never found.' He said she recovered quickly and was 'so determined' to catch up with her friends after missing nine months of school she did a year’s work in just one month, later coming top of her class. However, she relapsed in April 2011 and became convinced she could not use her legs. Her parents tended to her while trying to convince her she was perfectly fit. Dr Hommel added: 'From the age of 16 she started to go to the doctors to seek diagnoses for a neurological disease she believed she suffered from and seek a cure for her paralysis. 'In September 2011 she cut off all her school friends and never spoke to them again.' During that time she was bedbound for 18 months in hospital, but decided one day she was better and started getting involved as an actress and planning to go to America to finish her studies, the inquest heard. When she was 18 she had her appendix removed without telling her parents. In May 2014, after going under anaesthetic for an 'unnecessary operation' she began to hear voices. She also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and spent three to four hours a day washing herself and her possessions, leaving her skin raw and bleeding. At one point she was admitted to hospital after her body mass index dropped to 15, the inquest heard. The inquest heard that Miss Hadley, pictured, suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk. She was treated at the Priory clinic for OCD, but was released because she refused food and doctors feared she would starve herself to death unless she was allowed to return home and be treated there. Her father explained: 'We sought expert psychiatric help for her which she rejected. 'She became increasingly psychotic, the voices returned with intensity. She never accepted help. It was unintelligible to her that her illnesses were not physical. We hope she is finally at peace and her soul is in a better place.' Jonathan Bindman, who worked at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust, took charge of Miss Hadley’s treatment after she was released from The Priory in October 2014. He diagnosed her with somatoform disorder, an anxiety-related condition whose sufferers feel real pain that can’t be medically explained. However, he said that had she revealed the extent of her psychosis he would have diagnosed her with schizophrenia and given her the treatment she needed. He added: 'Zoe was not prepared to cooperate.

'She experienced delusions around the issue her father and a surgeon had faked an operation and was conspiring against her.'

'She was very intelligent and used her intelligence at times to share with those around her as much as she wanted them to know and did so successfully. 'Her illness was incredibly disabling and completely affected every aspect of her life. 'She was suffering from a psychotic illness which impacted on her decision to take her own life.

993,"Zoe Hadley, also known as Zoe Hommel, who hanged herself in a hotel room after suffering a mystery illness. The teenage daughter of a leading solicitor hanged herself in a hotel room after years of suffering a mystery illness that left her unable to eat, walk or open her eyes for long periods, an inquest has heard. Zoe Hadley, 19, also known as Zoe Hommel, had been battling an undiagnosed illness since the age of 13 and was found dead at a hotel in Putney, south west London last year. An inquest at Westminster Coroners Court heard how her parents, solicitor Lisa Hommel and her GP father Laurence, struggled to treat her condition. The inquest heard how doctors could find no physical cause for her illness and that the teenager refused to accept she had mental health problems. She insisted on having a series of operations, including the removal of her healthy appendix and accused her father of conspiring to fake an operation to make her believe she'd had a surgery for a prolapse. The inquest also heard that Miss Hadley suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk. After her death, notes she had written saying she was 'tormented by voices' indicating she might have been suffering from schizophrenia, the hearing was told. A statement read to the hearing on behalf of her father, Dr Hommel, described how he and his wife fought to cope with their daughter’s illness and their vain attempts to help her. He said: 'She was a beautiful, intelligent, loving daughter. 'Up until the age of 13 she excelled at school. In 2009 she started to suffer terrible headaches and no physical causes were found. 'She was not eating, drinking or opening her eyes. It took her three months of treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital to open her eyes and look at us, four months to eat solid food, six months before she could get into a wheelchair. The cause of the illness was never found.' He said she recovered quickly and was 'so determined' to catch up with her friends after missing nine months of school she did a year’s work in just one month, later coming top of her class. However, she relapsed in April 2011 and became convinced she could not use her legs. Her parents tended to her while trying to convince her she was perfectly fit. Dr Hommel added: 'From the age of 16 she started to go to the doctors to seek diagnoses for a neurological disease she believed she suffered from and seek a cure for her paralysis. 'In September 2011 she cut off all her school friends and never spoke to them again.' During that time she was bedbound for 18 months in hospital, but decided one day she was better and started getting involved as an actress and planning to go to America to finish her studies, the inquest heard. When she was 18 she had her appendix removed without telling her parents. In May 2014, after going under anaesthetic for an 'unnecessary operation' she began to hear voices. She also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and spent three to four hours a day washing herself and her possessions, leaving her skin raw and bleeding. At one point she was admitted to hospital after her body mass index dropped to 15, the inquest heard.

1011,"An internal inquiry by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in 2009 concluded that Reserve Deputy Robert Bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency. Bates is the volunteer deputy who fatally shot suspect Eric Harris instead of stunning him with a Taser on April 2. A Harris family lawyer provided documents to CNN from the 2009 inquiry, which also found that supervisors intimidated employees to disregard policies to the benefit of Bates. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has not responded to repeated calls for comment from CNN. An attorney for Bates, Clark O. Brewster, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday that he disputed the findings in the report and maintained that his client had the proper training. Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting of Harris. He pleaded not guilty. Bates was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates has said he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after the suspect fled from officers but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? The attorney for the Harris family said that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The sheriff's office denied the allegations in the newspaper's report. It also declined a CNN interview to respond to the claims. Over the weekend, one of Bates' attorneys released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training. However, the records were incomplete. Bates' attorney, Brewster, characterized the 2009 memo as something borne out of jealousy by other officers. The allegations made in the report are the result of misunderstandings and misstatements, he said. The memos obtained by CNN show that a ""special investigation"" was launched in July 2009 at the request of then-Undersheriff Brian Edwards. Edwards asked investigators to look at two questions specifically: Was Bates being treated differently than any other reserve deputies, and were any employees pressured by supervisors to aid Bates? The investigation found that some employees felt pressured to sign off on certificates for training that Bates had not completed. Police caught on camera: The good and the bad. On Friday, the Tulsa County district attorney's office said it had received new information -- likely the 2009 memo -- that ""are worthy of further investigation beyond the scope of the manslaughter case."" The DA's office is reaching out to independent law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Contrary to claims by the sheriff's office that Bates had the required training to be in the field, the 2009 memo indicates otherwise. The document names then-Chief Deputy Tim Albin (currently undersheriff) and then-Capt. Tom Huckeby (now a major) as two supervisors who allegedly pressured lower-ranking officers to make exceptions or falsify records for Bates. One deputy reported that he was tasked with providing field training for Bates. The written policy is that a reserve deputy is required to have 480 hours of training, but that Huckeby and Albin pressured the trainer to write that Bates was qualified after only 320 hours. The trainer, fearing reassignment if he did not comply, signed a memo stating that Bates had completed 328 hours of training, and did not elaborate on details of the training. Later, the memo was amended by his superiors to read, in part, that Bates was ""capable of performing the functions of a patrol deputy."" The training deputy said he initialed the changes, even though he didn't think Bates was properly trained. According to the investigation memo, the trainer said that if he was honest, he would have said Bates needed remedial training, and that the reserve deputy was ""not really good at traffic stops or operations."" The internal investigation only turned up 72 hours of documented training. The trainer maintained that he oversaw 328 hours of training, but that the records were sent not to the records office, but instead to Huckeby. Brewster denied the claims made by the trainer, and alleged that trainer lost his job in part because of his conduct during the internal inquiry. Another deputy said that she signed a driving certificate for Bates, even though she believed he had not completed the training. Albin asked the deputy to make the certificate, and she did so without questioning him, according to the investigation. The memo lists other instances where Bates performed operations that he wasn't supposed to, given his stature in the department, but that complaints by other officers were dismissed by supervisors. Those who complained about Bates, according to the memo, were told to leave him alone or to make an exception, citing that he did a lot of good for the county and was close with the top leaders in the agency.

Therefore, the summary contains hallucinated content. 

Response: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document in relation to the highlighted sentence.

1. **Claim about Training**: The highlighted sentence states that ""Tulsa County officials have said that Robert Bates had the proper training in law enforcement."" The document presents conflicting information regarding Bates' training. While Bates' attorney claims he had proper training, the internal inquiry and the 2009 memo indicate that there were significant issues with his training records and that he may not have had the required training. Therefore, the assertion that officials said he had the proper training is not definitively supported by the document.

2. **Claim about the Incident**: The highlighted sentence also states that Bates ""neglected to use his Taser and shot Eric Harris instead."" The document confirms that Bates intended to use a Taser but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun. This part of the highlighted sentence aligns with the information in the document.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]"
1013,"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic. Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point. 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller. Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute. 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final. 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner. An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful. There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'
","Josh Meekings handball should have been a penalty and a red card. If the penalty was awarded and converted Celtic would have gone to 2-0.

",,0,1,1,0,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document:

1. **Josh Meekings handball should have been a penalty and a red card.** 
   - This is supported by the document, where it states that Meekings' handball ""should have also led to a sending off.""

2. **If the penalty was awarded and converted Celtic would have gone to 2-0.**
   - This is a factual hallucination. The document mentions that the penalty could have led to a 2-0 scoreline, but it does not state that the penalty was awarded or converted. Therefore, this statement cannot be directly inferred from the document.

3. **Caley manager John Hughes admitted his side were fortunate in win.**
   - This is supported by the document, where Hughes acknowledges that they got away with a penalty and a sending off, indicating a sense of fortune in their victory.

4. **Virgil van Dijk scored Celtic's opener with a superb free-kick.**
   - This is supported by the document, which states that ""Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick.""

5. **Celtic keeper Craig Gordon was sent off early in the second half.**
   - This is supported by the document, which mentions that Craig Gordon received a red card after a foul.

6. **Greg Tansey, Edward Ofere and finally Daven Raven scored for Caley.**
   - This statement contains hallucinated content. The document mentions that ""big Edward put us into the lead"" and ""we came up with the winner through David Raven,"" but it does not mention Greg Tansey scoring. Therefore, this part of the summary cannot be verified from the document.

Based on the analysis, the summary contains factual hallucinations regarding the penalty and the scoring of Greg Tansey. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""Celtic keeper Craig Gordon was sent off early in the second half."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document discusses a match between Inverness and Celtic, mentioning a penalty that Celtic did not receive and a red card for Craig Gordon.
2. It states that ""the other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon,"" indicating that Craig Gordon was indeed sent off during the match.
3. However, the document does not specify the timing of the red card, whether it was in the first half or the second half.

Given that the highlighted sentence claims that Craig Gordon was sent off ""early in the second half,"" and the document does not provide this specific timing, we cannot confirm this detail as supported. Therefore, it falls under the category of factual hallucination since it presents a specific timing that is not verifiable from the document.

Thus, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Craig Gordon was sent off early in the second half"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

In the document, it is mentioned that ""the other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon."" This indicates that Craig Gordon received a red card during the match. However, the document does not specify the exact timing of the red card, such as whether it occurred early in the second half or at a different time.

Since the isolated statement makes a specific claim about the timing of Craig Gordon's sending off (that it was ""early in the second half""), and this specific timing is not confirmed in the document, we cannot definitively support the statement based on the information provided.

Therefore, the isolated statement is not supported by the document and falls into the category of factual hallucination, as it presents a detail (the timing of the sending off) that is not verifiable from the document.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]"
1013,"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic. Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point. 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller. Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute. 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final. 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner. An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful. There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'
",,"Inverness's underdog victory over Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final was thanks to a penalty that was unjustly awarded against the opposing team, which resulted in a red card for Craig Gordon. If that had not happened, Celtic would have won the game. Despite the controversy, Caley manager John Hughes admits that his team deserved the win. Virgil van Dijk's goal in the 18th minute was the only highlight from Celtic.",1,1,1,1,1,"To determine whether the summary contains hallucinated content, we need to analyze the document and the summary step-by-step.

1. **Inverness's Victory**: The document discusses Inverness's victory over Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final, which is accurately reflected in the summary.

2. **Penalty and Red Card**: The document mentions a penalty that was awarded to Inverness and a red card for Craig Gordon, which aligns with the summary's claim about the penalty being unjustly awarded against Celtic.

3. **Celtic's Potential Victory**: The summary states that if the penalty and red card had not occurred, Celtic would have won the game. While the document implies that the penalty and red card were turning points, it does not explicitly state that Celtic would have won if those events had not happened. This introduces a level of speculation that is not directly supported by the document.

4. **Manager's Admission**: The summary claims that John Hughes admits his team deserved the win. The document does indicate that Hughes acknowledges the turning point and the luck involved, but it does not explicitly state that he believes they deserved the win in those terms.

5. **Virgil van Dijk's Goal**: The summary mentions Virgil van Dijk's goal as the only highlight from Celtic. The document states that he scored a free-kick in the 18th minute, but it does not indicate that this was the only highlight or that it was a significant moment beyond just being a goal.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains speculative content regarding Celtic's potential victory and misrepresents the manager's admission about deserving the win. Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and see if the claims made in the highlighted sentence can be inferred or are directly stated.

1. **Inverness's victory**: The document states that Inverness won against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final, which supports the claim of an ""underdog victory.""

2. **Penalty awarded**: The document discusses a penalty that was awarded to Inverness and mentions that Celtic did not receive a penalty for a handball that should have led to a sending off. This indicates that there was indeed a penalty involved in the match.

3. **Unjustly awarded**: The phrase ""unjustly awarded"" is subjective. The document includes comments from John Hughes, the Inverness manager, who acknowledges the penalty and the red card situation but does not explicitly state that the penalty was unjust. Instead, he reflects on the reactions of the Celtic players and the referee's decisions. Therefore, while there is a suggestion of controversy, the document does not definitively support the claim that the penalty was unjust.

4. **Resulting in a red card for Craig Gordon**: The document confirms that Craig Gordon received a red card, which is a factual statement.

5. **If that had not happened, Celtic would have won the game**: This part of the highlighted sentence is speculative and not supported by the document. The document does not provide any evidence or statements indicating that Celtic would have won if the penalty and red card had not occurred.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains elements that are supported by the document (the victory, the penalty, and the red card), but it also includes subjective and speculative claims that are not directly supported (the unjust nature of the penalty and the assertion that Celtic would have won).

Thus, the highlighted sentence is primarily based on subjective interpretation and speculation rather than direct support from the document.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""If that had not happened, Celtic would have won the game."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document's content.

1. The document discusses a Scottish Cup semi-final match where Inverness defeated Celtic. It mentions key moments, including a penalty awarded to Inverness and a red card for Celtic's Craig Gordon, which were described as turning points in the game.
2. The manager of Inverness, John Hughes, acknowledges the significance of these events, suggesting that they were crucial to Inverness's victory.
3. However, the document does not explicitly state that Celtic would have won the game if the penalty and red card had not occurred. It implies that these events were pivotal, but it does not provide a definitive conclusion about the outcome of the game without them.

The isolated statement makes a conditional claim about the outcome of the game that is not directly supported by the document. It is an inference that cannot be definitively drawn from the text, as the document does not provide evidence or reasoning to support the assertion that Celtic would have won if the penalty and red card had not happened.

Therefore, the isolated statement is not supported by the document and falls into the category of a factual hallucination, as it presents a scenario that is not verifiable based on the information provided.

1052,"Deborah Fuller has been banned from keeping animals after she dragged her dog behind her car, causing wounds as she drove at 30mph. A dog breeder and exhibitor who dragged her pet behind her car at a speed of 30mph and failed to get painful wounds to its paws and chest treated, has been banned from keeping animals and had her dogs confiscated. Deborah Fuller, 56, dragged her dog Tango for 400 metres behind her car as she drove along the B1066 near Long Melford, Essex. The Rhodesian ridgeback was left with injuries to all four paws as well as grazing to his chest and a deep wound on his elbow. He is believed to have somehow escaped from the boot of her car and was dragged along the single carriageway because his lead was attached to the vehicle's tailgate. Fuller, of Lawford, Essex, denied causing unnecessary suffering to an animal by not taking it to the vets and failing to take steps to safely secure a dog within a vehicle, but was convicted following a hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. Fuller has also been banned from keeping animals for five years and had her 27 other dogs confiscated. Chairman of the bench Anthony Ealden said if Tango had been taken to the vet earlier 'unnecessary suffering' could have been avoided. He said: 'We believe for whatever reason, known only to yourself, you had no intention of getting veterinary treatment as a matter of urgency. 'We do not accept your reason for delaying treatment as reasonable.' The incident took place on June 11, 2014, when the dog was seen being dragged along the B1006 behind the car. Tree surgeons working nearby spotted what had happened and tried to get Fuller, who is a Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder and exhibitor, to stop her car. She didn't stop until she reached the end of the carriageway and they took her registration number and reported her to police who called the RSPCA, the court heard. Tango was later found by inspectors  in an outbuilding at Fuller's home with bandages on his paws. He was taken to a vet and given treatment for his injuries, which took eight weeks. Tango was left with considerable injuries to his paws and stomach, as well as a deep elbow wound. Tango, a Rhodesian ridgeback, pictured before being injured by being dragged along the road. Fuller claimed she had not been aware the rear hatch of her car had opened and claimed she had given the one-year-old dog first aid, and had already arranged for him to go to the vet when police turned up. Mike Fullerton, defending Fuller, said:  'When Deborah Fuller was being restrained she asked why she was not allowed to take the dog to the vet.' RSPCA inspector Sam Garvey said after the sentencing: 'Eyewitnesses report they saw the dog being dragged about 400 metres at a speed of 30mph. 'This must have been horrific for poor Tango. So painful, and so distressing. 'It is hard to say what caused Tango to be dragged behind a moving car in this way, but by the time we found him, seven hours later, he was urgently in need of vet treatment. The animal was taken to the vets and treated for the burns, suffered when he was dragged along the road. Judges ruled that the dog's suffering could have been avoided if Fuller had taken him to the vets earlier. 'He had injuries to the pads of all four feet, causing the black layer of skin to be removed. He also had grazing to his chest area and a nasty deep wound to his elbow and leg area. 'It took a period of eight weeks to heal the wounds and for his skin to grow back over his pads so he could walk without discomfort.' Fuller was also ordered to pay £3,000 costs, given a 12 month community order and a two month curfew from 7pm to 7am. Tango was taken to a vet for treatment after being found and has made a full recovery in foster care. The court also allowed confiscation of all the animals owned by Fuller, which are currently in RSPCA care. Tango was removed from Fuller, along with more than 40 other dogs that were at her Essex home. Fuller and her partner Phil Sheldrake, 59, previously pleaded guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the dogs' needs at Colchester Magistrates Court in June. Earlier this month the case was thrown out after the High Court ruled that inspectors did have the correct warrant to seize 44 dogs from their Essex home. Tendring District Council had been granted a warrant to investigate 'nuisance' at the house, following complaints about noise and dog faeces. The council joined forces with the RSPCA and seized 44 dogs from the house, with the animal welfare charity claiming several of the animals were emaciated. However the trial was halted when district judge Kenneth Sheraton said evidence gathered by inspectors was inadmissible because they did not have the correct warrant.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]"
1069,"Ronny Deila has called for Caley Thistle’s Josh Meekings to be spared a Scottish Cup Final ban despite his controversial handball. The Celtic boss admitted the 2-1 Premiership victory at Dundee had helped him bounce back from what he described as the toughest day of his career at Hampden on Sunday. But although his club’s Treble ambitions were shattered as a result of the Meekings’ incident in the semi-final defeat to Inverness, the Norwegian said it would serve no purpose for the defender to be given a retrospective suspension by the SFA. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday. Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off. The fall-out from the Hampden showdown has been dominated by the failure of the match officials to award a penalty after Meekings blocked a goal-bound effort from Leigh Griffiths with his hand. Caley Thistle will learn today whether they have succeeded in overturning the suspension that compliance officer Tony McGlennan offered earlier this week. And while Celtic have written to the SFA seeking clarity over the pivotal incident, Deila insisted that he hopes Meekings is cleared to line up against Falkirk in the final on May 30. ‘It does not help our situation at all and I do not think that he did it on purpose,’ said the Parkhead manager. ‘It all happened so quickly and it is a clear handball and a red card and a penalty. ‘I don’t think that is right for him to miss that match as you want all the best players to play in the final. I would hope that the ban would be overturned.’ Deila said he was unaware of any response from Hampden to Celtic’s letter but said he can understand the scale of the furore that has erupted this week. FIFA vice president Jim Boyce yesterday waded in to the debate to strongly criticise the SFA’s decision to charge Meekings. ‘It is a huge thing as we are talking about the Treble here and the Scottish cup semi-final when we were 1-0 up,’ added Deila. FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong. Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final. ‘I am trying to focus on the next game and we have performed very well since Christmas and we have racked up a lot of wins and points.’ Deila admitted he had hit an all-time low after the 3-2 extra-time defeat to John Hughes’ side last Sunday. But he had his spirits restored at Dens Park last night as goals from Gary Mackay-Steven and Virgil van Dijk secured victory over Dundee, who struck a late consolation through Jim McAlister. The result pushed Celtic closer to the Premiership title as they hold an eight-point lead over Aberdeen with just five games to go. ‘It was the toughest day of my career on Sunday,’ reflected Deila. ‘I have to admit that.

1069,"Ronny Deila has called for Caley Thistle’s Josh Meekings to be spared a Scottish Cup Final ban despite his controversial handball. The Celtic boss admitted the 2-1 Premiership victory at Dundee had helped him bounce back from what he described as the toughest day of his career at Hampden on Sunday. But although his club’s Treble ambitions were shattered as a result of the Meekings’ incident in the semi-final defeat to Inverness, the Norwegian said it would serve no purpose for the defender to be given a retrospective suspension by the SFA. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday. Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off. The fall-out from the Hampden showdown has been dominated by the failure of the match officials to award a penalty after Meekings blocked a goal-bound effort from Leigh Griffiths with his hand. Caley Thistle will learn today whether they have succeeded in overturning the suspension that compliance officer Tony McGlennan offered earlier this week. And while Celtic have written to the SFA seeking clarity over the pivotal incident, Deila insisted that he hopes Meekings is cleared to line up against Falkirk in the final on May 30. ‘It does not help our situation at all and I do not think that he did it on purpose,’ said the Parkhead manager. ‘It all happened so quickly and it is a clear handball and a red card and a penalty. ‘I don’t think that is right for him to miss that match as you want all the best players to play in the final. I would hope that the ban would be overturned.’ Deila said he was unaware of any response from Hampden to Celtic’s letter but said he can understand the scale of the furore that has erupted this week. FIFA vice president Jim Boyce yesterday waded in to the debate to strongly criticise the SFA’s decision to charge Meekings. ‘It is a huge thing as we are talking about the Treble here and the Scottish cup semi-final when we were 1-0 up,’ added Deila. FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong. Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final. ‘I am trying to focus on the next game and we have performed very well since Christmas and we have racked up a lot of wins and points.’ Deila admitted he had hit an all-time low after the 3-2 extra-time defeat to John Hughes’ side last Sunday. But he had his spirits restored at Dens Park last night as goals from Gary Mackay-Steven and Virgil van Dijk secured victory over Dundee, who struck a late consolation through Jim McAlister. The result pushed Celtic closer to the Premiership title as they hold an eight-point lead over Aberdeen with just five games to go. ‘It was the toughest day of my career on Sunday,’ reflected Deila. ‘I have to admit that. It was very tough. Meekings (right) celebrates Inverness's 3-2 win over Celtic in their Scottish Cup semi-final. ‘We really wanted it and we had a very good opportunity there.

1083,"Surkhet, Nepal (CNN)Ten years ago, with her high school diploma and a backpack, Maggie Doyne left her New Jersey hometown to travel the world before college. She lived in a Buddhist monastery, helped rebuild a sea wall in Fiji, then went to India and worked with Nepalese refugees. There, she met a young girl who wanted to find her family in Nepal. Doyne went with her. That's when Doyne's life took an unexpected turn. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015. A decade-long civil war had just ended in the country, and Doyne witnessed its effects firsthand. She met women and children who were suffering, struggling to survive. ""It changed me,"" said Doyne, now 28. ""There were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed, pick up a big stone and break it into little, little pieces (to sell). And they were doing that all day, every day."" Doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $5,000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in Surkhet, a district in western Nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the Kopila Valley Children's Home. Today, Kopila -- which means ""flower bud"" in Nepali -- is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the BlinkNow Foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its Kopila Valley School, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in Nepal year-round, traveling to the U.S. a few times a year. See more CNN Heroes. The CNN Heroes team traveled to Surkhet and talked to Doyne about her work and the community she supports. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: How does it work, raising nearly 50 kids? Maggie Doyne: It's communal living, for sure! We're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years. Everybody just pitches in and helps each other. They all have their chores. They all have their duties. And everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly. The staff at the home, we call them the aunties and the uncles. We wake up in the morning and go off to school. And then come home and do homework and eat our meals together, and everybody goes to bed at night. CNN: How does a child come to live in your home? Doyne: Our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible. In order to come into the home, you need to have lost both parents, or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect, abuse or have a parent who's incarcerated. We have to conduct a full investigation. So usually that involves going to the child's village, making calls, doing police checks, getting documentation and paperwork. We have to dig up birth certificates, death certificates, make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does. CNN: Meanwhile, you have 350 children attending your school. What is their background? Doyne: Every single year we'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants. And we choose the ones who are the most needful and really won't be in school without us. Most of them live in one room, a mud hut. A lot of them are just in survival mode. We try to relieve the burden from the family, so that the child has food, medical care, books, zero fees for education. CNN: What have you learned working with the local community in Nepal? Doyne: I learned very early on, from the beginning, that I couldn't come in and just be like, ""Here, I have a vision. This is what we're going to do."" That doesn't work. It has to be slow; it has to be organic. And it has to come from the community and be a ""we"" thing. It's really important to me that this is a Nepali project, working for Nepal, for the community. So the faces that you see are strong Nepali women and amazing Nepali role-model men. CNN: How does the project continue to grow? Doyne: We started with the home and then school. We run the school lunch program. Then we needed to keep our kids really healthy, so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center. From there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food. And then from there we decided to start a women's center. We just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off-the-grid campus. This year we converted to solar energy. So we'll have a high school and then a day care, preschool, elementary, all the way up, and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward. It's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream. It's become a community. And I want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like. Want to get involved?

The woman in question claimed to have been raped while she was asleep, but some fans of the show have expressed disbelief.",1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **Key Points from the Document**:
   - A contestant named Siyanda Ngwenya was expelled from Big Brother after being accused of raping a female housemate.
   - The alleged incident occurred after a night of partying, and the woman reportedly did not consent to the sexual encounter.
   - The channel airing the show stated that it was unclear what transpired, but they acted on the suspicion of sexual misconduct.
   - There are mixed reactions from fans, with some questioning the woman's claims.

2. **Key Points from the Summary**:
   - The summary states that controversy erupted after a housemate was expelled for allegedly kissing and cuddling with a fellow contestant.
   - It mentions that the woman claimed to have been raped while asleep.
   - It also notes that some fans expressed disbelief regarding the allegations.

3. **Analysis of Hallucinations**:
   - The summary correctly mentions the expulsion of a contestant and the claim of rape, which aligns with the document.
   - However, the summary inaccurately simplifies the reason for the expulsion to just ""kissing and cuddling,"" which downplays the serious nature of the allegations of rape and sexual misconduct mentioned in the document. This could be seen as a factual hallucination because it misrepresents the gravity of the situation.
   - The mention of fans expressing disbelief is supported by the document, as it reflects the mixed reactions from the audience.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains hallucinated content due to the misrepresentation of the reasons for the expulsion. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and how it relates to the highlighted sentence.

1. The document discusses an incident involving a contestant named Siyanda Ngwenya (Adams) who was expelled from the South African version of Big Brother after being accused of raping a fellow housemate. 
2. It mentions that the pair were last seen on TV kissing and cuddling before the alleged incident occurred.
3. The document indicates that there is controversy surrounding the situation, particularly regarding the claims of sexual misconduct and the reactions from fans of the show.

Now, let's break down the highlighted sentence:
- The highlighted sentence states that ""Controversy has erupted in the South African version of Big Brother after a housemate was expelled from the house for allegedly kissing and cuddling with a fellow contestant.""
- The document supports the idea that there is controversy due to the expulsion of a contestant and the circumstances surrounding it, including the kissing and cuddling that occurred before the alleged incident.

However, the highlighted sentence inaccurately implies that the expulsion was solely for ""allegedly kissing and cuddling,"" which is misleading. The expulsion was due to accusations of rape, not just the kissing and cuddling. This misrepresentation of the reason for expulsion introduces an intrinsic hallucination, as it contradicts the document's content regarding the seriousness of the allegations.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence is not fully supported by the document and contains a contradiction regarding the reasons for the expulsion.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and how it relates to the isolated statement.

1. The document states that a contestant, Siyanda Ngwenya, was expelled from the South African version of Big Brother after being accused of raping a fellow housemate. It mentions that the alleged incident occurred after a drunken night of partying and that the pair were last seen on TV kissing and cuddling in bed.

2. The highlighted sentence from the summary indicates that the expulsion was related to the housemate allegedly kissing and cuddling with a fellow contestant. 

3. The isolated statement specifically claims, ""The expulsion was due to the housemate allegedly kissing and cuddling with a fellow contestant."" 

Now, let's evaluate the accuracy of the isolated statement:

- The document does mention that the pair were seen kissing and cuddling, but it also emphasizes that the expulsion was primarily due to the serious accusation of rape, not merely the act of kissing and cuddling. The channel's statement indicates that they acted on the suspicion of sexual misconduct, which is a more serious issue than just kissing and cuddling.

- Therefore, the isolated statement simplifies the reason for the expulsion and does not accurately reflect the context provided in the document. It implies that the expulsion was solely due to the kissing and cuddling, which is misleading.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement does not accurately represent the information in the document and can be classified as a factual hallucination.

Final response: [SUPPORTED]",0,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document in relation to the highlighted sentence.

The highlighted sentence states: ""Brendan Rodgers concedes that Daniel Sturridge will not rediscover his best form this season after a number of injury problems.""

In the document, there are several references to Daniel Sturridge's injury issues and his struggle to regain form. Specifically, it mentions that Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season due to the injuries he has suffered. The document also includes a quote from Brendan Rodgers that supports the idea that Sturridge has had a difficult season due to multiple injuries and that it may take time for him to return to form.

Since the highlighted sentence accurately reflects the information provided in the document and can be directly inferred from it, we can conclude that it is supported.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [SUPPORTED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The return is expected to happen on Monday"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. The document states that Jordon Ibe could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The use of ""could"" indicates a possibility rather than a certainty.

2. The isolated statement uses the word ""expected,"" which implies a stronger sense of certainty than ""could."" This suggests that the isolated statement is making a definitive claim about the return happening on Monday, which is not supported by the document's wording.

3. Since the document does not confirm that the return will definitely happen on Monday, but rather that it is a possibility, the isolated statement does not accurately reflect the information provided in the document.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement is not supported by the document and instead misrepresents the level of certainty regarding Ibe's return.

2. **Signing a New Contract**: The summary correctly states that Ibe is set to sign a new long-term contract with Liverpool, which is supported by the document.

3. **Brendan Rodgers' Preparation**: The summary mentions that Rodgers is preparing to launch Ibe's new season, which aligns with the document's content about Ibe's return and the manager's plans.

4. **Formation**: The summary claims that Rodgers will stick with the 4-3-3 formation used at Blackburn in the FA Cup. The document mentions that Rodgers is considering whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation or revert to a 3-4-3 system.

In FP2, and with the natural order restored as they finished first and second at the top of the timesheet, just 0.115secs was the gap at the end of their runs on the soft Pirelli tyre, the quicker of the two compounds this weekend. That was due to a lock-up from Hamilton in the second sector of the Bahrain International Circuit which cost him four tenths of a second, otherwise he would likely have beaten Rosberg by three tenths given he was faster in sectors one and two.

It mentions that both drivers finished 15th and 16th in FP1, indicating that they did not perform well in that session. The phrase ""came to the fore"" typically implies that they excelled or performed significantly better, which contradicts their actual positions in FP1.

2. **Analyzing the Highlighted Sentence**: The highlighted sentence states that they finished first and second respectively, which refers to their performance in FP2, not FP1. This is a crucial distinction because the isolated statement refers to FP1, where they did not perform well.

The duffel bag was found shortly before 8am near a building used by biotechnology company Biogen Inc. and a block from a police station, Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan said. Video surveillance of the area led police to an apartment complex across the street where additional human remains were found in a common area, authorities said. Scroll down for video. Police investigated the scene after human remains were discovered at about 8am on Saturday near a biotechnology company's building in Cambridge, Massachusetts. All of the remains are believed to belong to one person, whose death is being treated as a homicide, Ryan said. She announced at an evening news conference that a person had been arrested in the case but provided no details. The name of the victim also was not released. Ryan said the person under arrest would be arraigned Monday in Cambridge District Court on charges of being an accessory after the crime of assault and battery and improper disposal of human remains. Authorities stopped short of saying whether they believed the person arrested was the killer. During a news conference police announced that a person has been arrested in the case but no details have been released. Surveillance footage led police to this pictured apartment building, where more human remains - believed to belong to the same victim - were found in a common area.

1. **Discovery of human remains**: The summary correctly states that human remains were found outside Biogen Inc. in Cambridge, which is supported by the document.

2. **Arrest in connection with the case**: The summary mentions that an arrest was made, which is also supported by the document.

3. **Accusation of being the killer**: The summary states that the person under arrest is accused of being the killer. However, the document explicitly states that authorities ""stopped short of saying whether they believed the person arrested was the killer."" This indicates that the summary contains an intrinsic hallucination, as it contradicts the information in the document.

4. **Hiding the remains in a nearby apartment complex**: The summary implies that the arrested person hid the remains, which is not directly stated in the document. The document mentions that additional remains were found in a common area of an apartment complex, but it does not attribute the act of hiding the remains to the arrested individual.

5. **Community safety**: The summary concludes that the community is not believed to be in danger, which is supported by the document where the police commissioner states, ""We don't think there's a threat to the community at this point in time.""

1. **Dangerous Worker**: The document describes a worker who was performing a dangerous task by jet washing a roof with minimal safety equipment. This aligns with the summary's description of a ""dangerous worker.""

2. **Cleaning a Roof with Just Rope**: The document states that the worker was on the roof with ""just a rope tied around him for safety."" This is accurately reflected in the summary.

3. **Caught on Camera by a Vigilant Neighbor**: The document mentions that a local resident noticed the worker and took snaps of him. The summary's claim that he was ""caught on camera by a vigilant neighbor"" is a reasonable paraphrase of this information.

4. **Reported to Authorities**: The document states that the image was passed to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), who then attended the property. The summary's mention of being reported to authorities is supported by the document.

5. **Issued a Notice Restraining the Potentially Murderous Practice**: The document mentions that the HSE served a prohibition notice, meaning the work had to cease until appropriate safety measures were put in place. However, the term ""potentially murderous practice"" is not found in the document and introduces a subjective interpretation that is not supported by the text. This could be seen as an exaggeration or a non-factual hallucination.

Based on this analysis, the summary does contain hallucinated content, specifically in the phrase ""potentially murderous practice,"" which is not supported by the document.

Therefore, the response is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""Authorities promptly issued a notice restraining the potentially murderous practice."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

4. The document mentions that the image was passed to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), who then visited the property and issued a prohibition notice, which means the work had to cease until appropriate safety measures were put in place.

Now, let's analyze the highlighted sentence:
- The phrase ""Authorities promptly issued a notice"" aligns with the document's information that the HSE issued a prohibition notice after visiting the site.
- The term ""restraining the potentially murderous practice"" is more dramatic than what is stated in the document. While the document indicates that the work was dangerous and that safety measures were necessary, it does not explicitly label the practice as ""potentially murderous."" This could be seen as an exaggeration or a subjective interpretation of the situation.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains an element of exaggeration regarding the nature of the practice being ""potentially murderous,"" which is not directly supported by the document. Therefore, it can be classified as a factual hallucination.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The practice is described as potentially murderous"" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Context from the Document**: The document describes a worker performing dangerous tasks without proper safety equipment, which raises concerns about safety. It mentions that a building expert criticized the lack of safety measures and highlighted the risks involved in the worker's actions. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was involved after a concern was raised, and they issued a prohibition notice to stop the work until safety measures were in place.

2. **Context from the Summary**: The summary states that the worker was cleaning a roof with just a rope tied around his waist and that authorities issued a notice restraining the practice. The term ""potentially murderous practice"" implies that the actions taken by the worker could lead to severe injury or death due to the lack of safety measures.

3. **Analysis of the Isolated Statement**: The phrase ""potentially murderous"" is a strong characterization. While the document discusses the dangers and risks associated with the worker's actions, it does not explicitly use the term ""murderous"" or suggest that the practice is intended to cause harm. The use of ""potentially murderous"" could be seen as an exaggeration or a subjective interpretation of the risks involved.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the document does not support the characterization of the practice as ""potentially murderous"" and does not use that specific language, the isolated statement can be considered a non-factual hallucination.

There has been very little information to help Ms English find her birth mother who made the heartbreaking decision to give her up and for more than 40 years she has had many questions about her heritage. She was finally given a chance to find closure with ABC's Foreign Correspondent reporter Sally Sara who travelled with her to Vietnam in search of answers. Scroll down for video. Sophie English (right) with another adoptee Le My Huong who has since found her mother and moved back to Vietnam. The last time Ms English had seen her home country was when she was 10 months old. Despite being grateful for the opportunity to call herself Australian, she has always struggled with the pain of not knowing her birth mother and wondering what her life could have been. 'If you think about it too long it could make you cry because... there aren't words that could convey it,' Ms English told the ABC. 'I might've been on the boats, fishing and I would be working really hard like them, but I would have that sense of family. Ms English pictured here with some snakes in Truong Long village, Vietnam on her trip with Foreign Correspondent. Ms English (pictured with Ms My Huong and ABC journalist Sally Sara) goes on a journey to re-connect with her mother land, Vietnam. 'I would probably have grandchildren by now and I would have that deep need in me fulfilled.' Journalist Sally Sara told Daily Mail Australia Ms English's story was not about finding her mother but finding 'peace with her mother land'. While they were in Vietnam, Ms English got the chance to meet another adoptee, Le My Huong, who had a similar story to hers. Ms Le has been lucky enough to find her mother and has since moved back to Vietnam to be with her family. Sara said Ms English and Ms Le meeting for the first time was a profound moment in their journey. 'That was probably most raw and powerful moment of the whole story when Sophie got to sit down with My Huong’s mum,' Sara told Daily Mail Australia. 'This was the first time [Sophie] had met with a Vietnamese mother who had given up a child during the war.'

A crowded beach in Vung Tau in Vietnam - the country where Ms English was sent to Australia for adoption when she was 10 months old. Young women posing in Ho Chi Minh city, formally known as Saigon, which was one of the main locations of conflict during the Vietnam War. Sara said it was very moving to see the exchange between Ms English and My Huong's mother. 'Sophie wanted to ask My Huong's mum what it was like to give up a child and how hard that was,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The most important thing Sophie couldn't say these things to her mother [instead] she held onto My Huong's mum's hand [and said] as adoptees we don't blame you, you did what you had to do and don't feel guilty about that and be proud of the lives we had.' Sara said she was not sure if the trip gave Ms English the closure she needed to move on but had given her valuable insight on how to move forward. 'How could you ever extinguish hope of finding your mother?' she said. '[Sophie] was pretty amazing. She said she cried more in two weeks than her whole life. 'I would say Sophie's a very strong, intelligent woman and I really admire the way that she's handled this whole situation.' Foreign Correspondent airs on Tuesday from 8pm on ABC.

1. **Sophie English was one of thousands of babies born during the Vietnam War.** 
   - This is supported by the document, which states that Sophie was born at the height of the Vietnam War.

2. **She was adopted by an Australian family and has never known her birth mother.**
   - The document confirms that Sophie was adopted by an Australian family and has struggled with not knowing her birth mother.

3. **Ms English travelled to Vietnam to try to reconnect with her home country.**
   - This is also supported by the document, which mentions her trip to Vietnam in search of answers about her heritage.

4. **There she met another adoptee, Le My Huong, and her biological mother.**
   - The document states that Sophie met Le My Huong, who had found her mother, but it does not explicitly say that Sophie met My Huong's biological mother. This could be interpreted as a factual hallucination since it implies a direct meeting that is not clearly stated in the document.

5. **She was able to get some insight on her own adoption from My Huong's mother.**
   - The document mentions that Sophie wanted to ask My Huong's mother about giving up a child and that she held her hand to express understanding, which suggests she gained some insight. However, the summary implies a more direct exchange of insight than what is explicitly stated in the document.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the direct meeting with My Huong's biological mother and the implication of gaining insight from her. Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

4. It also mentions that while it is uncertain if the trip gave Sophie the closure she needed, it provided her with valuable insight on how to move forward.

From this analysis, we can infer that the highlighted sentence is indeed supported by the document. It aligns with the information that Sophie gained insight from her interaction with My Huong's mother regarding her own adoption experience.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [SUPPORTED].",0,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""She received this insight from My Huong's mother"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

The document states that during her trip to Vietnam, Sophie English met Le My Huong and her mother. It mentions that Sophie wanted to ask My Huong's mother about the experience of giving up a child and that she held her hand and expressed understanding and support as adoptees. The document also indicates that journalist Sally Sara noted that Sophie gained valuable insight on how to move forward, although it does not explicitly state that the insight was directly given by My Huong's mother.

However, the context implies that the interaction with My Huong's mother contributed to Sophie's understanding of her own situation as an adoptee. Therefore, the isolated statement can be inferred from the document, as it aligns with the overall narrative of Sophie seeking understanding through her connection with My Huong's mother.

Thus, the isolated statement is supported by the document.

1149,"Sophie English was one of thousands of babies who was born at the height of the Vietnam War and adopted by an Australian family. There has been very little information to help Ms English find her birth mother who made the heartbreaking decision to give her up and for more than 40 years she has had many questions about her heritage. She was finally given a chance to find closure with ABC's Foreign Correspondent reporter Sally Sara who travelled with her to Vietnam in search of answers. Scroll down for video. Sophie English (right) with another adoptee Le My Huong who has since found her mother and moved back to Vietnam. The last time Ms English had seen her home country was when she was 10 months old. Despite being grateful for the opportunity to call herself Australian, she has always struggled with the pain of not knowing her birth mother and wondering what her life could have been. 'If you think about it too long it could make you cry because... there aren't words that could convey it,' Ms English told the ABC. 'I might've been on the boats, fishing and I would be working really hard like them, but I would have that sense of family. Ms English pictured here with some snakes in Truong Long village, Vietnam on her trip with Foreign Correspondent. Ms English (pictured with Ms My Huong and ABC journalist Sally Sara) goes on a journey to re-connect with her mother land, Vietnam. 'I would probably have grandchildren by now and I would have that deep need in me fulfilled.' Journalist Sally Sara told Daily Mail Australia Ms English's story was not about finding her mother but finding 'peace with her mother land'. While they were in Vietnam, Ms English got the chance to meet another adoptee, Le My Huong, who had a similar story to hers. Ms Le has been lucky enough to find her mother and has since moved back to Vietnam to be with her family. Sara said Ms English and Ms Le meeting for the first time was a profound moment in their journey. 'That was probably most raw and powerful moment of the whole story when Sophie got to sit down with My Huong’s mum,' Sara told Daily Mail Australia. 'This was the first time [Sophie] had met with a Vietnamese mother who had given up a child during the war.'

Sara said it was very moving to see the exchange between Ms English and My Huong's mother. 'Sophie wanted to ask My Huong's mum what it was like to give up a child and how hard that was,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The most important thing Sophie couldn't say these things to her mother [instead] she held onto My Huong's mum's hand [and said] as adoptees we don't blame you, you did what you had to do and don't feel guilty about that and be proud of the lives we had.' Sara said she was not sure if the trip gave Ms English the closure she needed to move on but had given her valuable insight on how to move forward. 'How could you ever extinguish hope of finding your mother?' she said. '[Sophie] was pretty amazing. She said she cried more in two weeks than her whole life. 'I would say Sophie's a very strong, intelligent woman and I really admire the way that she's handled this whole situation.' Foreign Correspondent airs on Tuesday from 8pm on ABC.
",,"After being abandoned in the midst of the Vietnam War, Sophie English was adopted by a loving Australian family. After years of searching, she finally got the chance to visit her homeland and reconnect with her biological mother. With the help of journalist Sally Sara, Ms English was able to discover the truth about her past and find the closure she needed.",1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document provided.

1. **Abandonment and Adoption**: The summary states that Sophie English was ""abandoned in the midst of the Vietnam War"" and adopted by an Australian family. The document confirms that she was born during the Vietnam War and adopted by an Australian family, so this part is supported.

2. **Searching for Biological Mother**: The summary mentions that after years of searching, she had the chance to visit her homeland and reconnect with her biological mother. The document indicates that Sophie has had many questions about her heritage and was given a chance to find closure, but it does not explicitly state that she was able to reconnect with her biological mother. Instead, it mentions her meeting with another adoptee's mother, which is a different context. This introduces a factual hallucination because the summary implies a direct reconnection with her biological mother, which is not supported by the document.

3. **Help from Journalist Sally Sara**: The summary states that with the help of journalist Sally Sara, Ms. English was able to discover the truth about her past. The document does mention Sally Sara's involvement in the journey, but it does not confirm that Sophie discovered the truth about her past in a way that implies she found her biological mother. This again suggests a factual hallucination.

4. **Finding Closure**: The summary concludes that Sophie found the closure she needed. The document states that it is uncertain if the trip gave her the closure she needed, which contradicts the summary's assertion. This introduces an intrinsic hallucination.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains hallucinated content, specifically factual hallucinations regarding the reconnection with her biological mother and intrinsic hallucinations regarding the closure she found.

Therefore, the response is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the content of the document.

1. The document states that Sophie English was adopted and has had many questions about her heritage for over 40 years. This indicates a long period of searching for information about her birth mother.
2. It mentions that she was given a chance to find closure with the help of journalist Sally Sara, who traveled with her to Vietnam in search of answers. This implies that she did visit her homeland.
3. However, the document does not state that she was able to reconnect with her biological mother. It mentions that she met another adoptee, Le My Huong, and had a profound moment with My Huong's mother, but it does not confirm that she met her own biological mother.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence claims that Sophie English was able to ""reconnect with her biological mother,"" which is not supported by the document. The document does not provide evidence that she found or met her biological mother during her visit.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence contains a factual hallucination.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""She was able to reconnect with her biological mother"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

",,The Post Office has been accused of deliberately persecuting subpostmasters due to cash shortfalls caused by human error or cyber criminals. A leaked report has revealed that claims of an IT system fault are unfounded. Many subpostmasters suffered from wrongful accusations and imprisonment.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **Accusation of Deliberate Persecution**: The summary states that the Post Office has been accused of ""deliberately persecuting"" subpostmasters. The document mentions that the Post Office failed to properly investigate the reasons for cash shortfalls and that some criminal cases were motivated by a desire to recover money, but it does not explicitly state that the Post Office was ""deliberately persecuting"" subpostmasters. This could be seen as an interpretation or an extrapolation beyond what is directly stated in the document.

2. **Causes of Cash Shortfalls**: The summary claims that cash shortfalls were caused by ""human error or cyber criminals."" The document does mention that discrepancies could have been caused by ""computer failures, cyber criminals or human error,"" which aligns with the summary. However, the summary does not mention the possibility of ""computer failures,"" which is a significant part of the document's content.

3. **Claims of IT System Fault**: The summary states that a leaked report has revealed that claims of an IT system fault are ""unfounded."" The document does not explicitly state that the claims are unfounded; rather, it suggests that there are serious concerns about the IT system and that it could be ""systemically flawed."" This is a misrepresentation of the document's content.

4. **Wrongful Accusations and Imprisonment**: The summary correctly states that many subpostmasters suffered from wrongful accusations and imprisonment, which is supported by the document.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains elements that are not directly supported by the document, particularly the assertion of ""deliberate persecution"" and the claim that the IT system fault claims are ""unfounded."" Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""A leaked report has revealed that claims of an IT system fault are unfounded."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document discusses a report that suggests discrepancies in cash shortfalls could have been caused by various factors, including computer failures, cyber criminals, or human error. It does not definitively state that claims of an IT system fault are unfounded; rather, it indicates that there are concerns about the Horizon IT system being potentially flawed.

2. The Post Office's response mentions that the review repeated complaints from a small number of former postmasters and did not provide new evidence to support the claims. However, this does not equate to stating that the claims of an IT system fault are unfounded.

3. The highlighted sentence makes a definitive claim that the report has revealed the claims of an IT system fault to be unfounded, which is not supported by the content of the document. The document presents a more nuanced view, indicating that there are serious concerns about the IT system without outright dismissing the claims.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence is not supported by the document and instead misrepresents the findings of the report.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The cash shortfalls are caused by human error."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. **Document Analysis**: The document discusses a report that suggests discrepancies in cash shortfalls could be caused by various factors, including computer failures, cyber criminals, or human error. It mentions that the Post Office failed to properly investigate these shortfalls before taking action against subpostmasters. The document does not definitively state that human error is the sole cause of the cash shortfalls; rather, it presents it as one of several possible explanations.

2. **Summary Context**: The summary states that the Post Office has been accused of deliberately persecuting subpostmasters due to cash shortfalls caused by human error or cyber criminals. This aligns with the document's mention of human error as a potential cause but does not confirm it as the definitive cause.

3. **Isolated Statement Evaluation**: The isolated statement claims that ""The cash shortfalls are caused by human error."" This is a definitive assertion that implies human error is the cause, without acknowledging the other potential causes mentioned in the document (such as computer failures or cyber criminals). 

Given that the document does not support the isolated statement as a definitive cause of cash shortfalls (it presents human error as one of several possibilities), the isolated statement can be classified as a factual hallucination. It presents a conclusion that is not directly supported by the evidence in the document.

'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’ It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland.

They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb. Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins.

We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’ Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment.

1. **Marcelo Bosch kicked penalty with last play of the game for victory.** 
   - This is supported by the document, which states that Bosch kicked a last-minute penalty to secure victory for Saracens.

2. **Saracens took a half-time lead of 6-5 despite Racing's dominance.**
   - This is also supported. The document mentions that Saracens had a one-point advantage at halftime (6-5) and that Racing Metro 92 was dominant during the match.

3. **Penalties from Charlie Hodgson (two) and Alex Goode for Sarries.**
   - This is supported as the document lists that Charlie Hodgson kicked two penalties and Alex Goode also contributed with a penalty.

4. **Racing 92 scrum-half Maxime Machenaud scored the game's only try.**
   - This is supported by the document, which states that Machenaud scored the only try of the first half.

5. **Saracens will return to France to face Clermont Auvergne in the semi.**

Referee Nigel Owens was escorted off the pitch by security but his call –penalising replacement lock Fabrice Metz with 10 seconds left on the clock – was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse. Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92. Marcelo Bosch kicks the match-winning penalty from long-range to snatch Saracen's a semi-final berth. Argentine Bosch raises his arms aloft after being entrusted with the final kick of the game.

'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. ‘I tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didn’t want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, “Why not? I can take it.” The rest is history. With kicks like this, you’re either the hero or the bad guy - I’m happy that it went my way.’ It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan O’Gara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne.

CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Racing are a team who, in their early years, would play wearing berets and bow ties. They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owens’ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties – either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. ‘We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb. Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens’ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. It’s earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant ‘Bosch, Bosch, Bosch’ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. Bosch's football skills aid his powerful kicking. Racing Metro 92 winger Teddy Thomas shows his speed to avoid Chris Wyles and escape the in-goal area. Sarries' stand-in captain Hodgson places his grubber kick underneath Wenceslas Lauret. Racing Metro and Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton (left) locks horns with Sarries winger David Strettle. Strettle is upended going for a high ball against Racing's Brice Dulin, who escapes a yellow card. ‘But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.’ Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line – although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass – and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks.

",,"Saracens have secured a place in the Champions Cup semifinals thanks to Marcelo Bosch's powerful strikes. Though Racing Metro 92 dominates the game, penalties from Charlie Hodgson (two) and Alex Goode along with Bosch's goal off of Fabrice Metz penalty made Sarries victorious. Saracens will face off against Clermont in the semifinals.",1,1,1,1,1,"To determine if the summary contains hallucinated content, we need to analyze the information presented in the document and compare it with the summary.

1. **Saracens' Victory**: The document confirms that Saracens won the match against Racing Metro 92, primarily due to Marcelo Bosch's last-minute penalty kick. This aligns with the summary stating that Saracens secured a place in the semifinals thanks to Bosch's powerful strikes.

2. **Game Dominance**: The summary mentions that Racing Metro 92 dominated the game. The document does indicate that Racing Metro had moments of control and that Saracens struggled at times, but it does not explicitly state that Racing dominated the game. This could be seen as an interpretation that is not directly supported by the document.

3. **Penalties**: The summary states that penalties from Charlie Hodgson (two) and Alex Goode, along with Bosch's goal from a penalty awarded due to Fabrice Metz's infraction, contributed to Saracens' victory. The document confirms that Hodgson kicked two penalties and Bosch scored a penalty, but it does not mention Goode scoring a penalty, which could be a factual hallucination.

4. **Next Match**: The summary correctly states that Saracens will face Clermont in the semifinals, which is supported by the document.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding Alex Goode's contribution to the penalties, as the document does not support that he scored a penalty. Additionally, the claim that Racing Metro 92 dominated the game is not explicitly supported by the document.

Therefore, the summary contains hallucinated content. 

Final response: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and see if the claims made in the highlighted sentence can be inferred or are directly stated.

1. The highlighted sentence states that ""Racing Metro 92 dominates the game."" The document mentions that Racing Metro 92 did most of the running and that Saracens were unable to build upon their lead, which supports the idea that Racing Metro 92 had a strong performance. Therefore, this part of the sentence is supported.

2. The sentence also mentions ""penalties from Charlie Hodgson (two) and Alex Goode along with Bosch's goal off of Fabrice Metz penalty made Sarries victorious."" The document confirms that Charlie Hodgson kicked two penalties and that Marcelo Bosch kicked the match-winning penalty. However, it does not explicitly state that Bosch's kick was off of a penalty awarded to Fabrice Metz, but rather that Metz was penalized, leading to Bosch's successful kick. 

3. The phrase ""Bosch's goal off of Fabrice Metz penalty"" could imply that Bosch's kick was a direct result of the penalty against Metz, which is somewhat misleading. The document does not clarify that Bosch's kick was specifically from Metz's penalty; it simply states that Metz was penalized before Bosch's kick.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the attribution of Bosch's kick to Metz's penalty, which is not explicitly supported by the document. Therefore, the highlighted sentence is classified as:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Racing Metro 92 dominates the game."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document describes a rugby match where Saracens faced Racing Metro 92. It mentions that Saracens won the match with a last-minute penalty kick by Marcelo Bosch.
2. The document states that ""we weren't great in the first half"" and that Saracens had a ""one-point advantage"" at halftime, suggesting that Racing Metro 92 was competitive and possibly had the upper hand during parts of the game.
3. The phrase ""Racing did most of the running"" indicates that Racing Metro 92 was actively attacking and likely had more possession or opportunities during the match.
4. However, the document also emphasizes that Saracens ultimately won the game, which contradicts the idea that Racing Metro 92 ""dominates"" the game in a conclusive sense.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement ""Racing Metro 92 dominates the game."" can be interpreted as a factual hallucination. While Racing Metro 92 may have had moments of control or competitiveness, the overall outcome was a victory for Saracens, which means they did not dominate the game in the end.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

Taking pride of place was a cluster of bottles, each of which contained dog fluff and a photo of the mutt it came from. ‘We’re running a competition to find new talent,’ explained the black-clad curator, brightly. ‘Maybe I’ll shave the cat next time I visit my parents,’ I thought to myself. ‘If I stick the fluff in a bottle, it might just win.’ Cultural revolution: New York is in the throes of a cultural revolution - but MOMA is still brilliant. Welcome, then, to Nu York, a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in Friends and Gossip Girl and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in Brooklyn and Queens - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme. Gone (mostly) are the rough tenements and in their place, a bustling network of shop-lined streets and some seriously classy bars and hotels. Among the latter was the Z Hotel, a stark block of a building decked out in the industrial-chic style so beloved of London hipsters. Stateside Shoreditch, as it were. It was all a far cry from Iceland where I had begun my trip, courtesy of an Icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of Reykjavik and the spectacular Golden Circle for up to seven days en route to Boston, Anchorage, Washington or, in my case, New York. Although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009, the Icelandic capital shows signs of recovery – not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the Apotek Hotel, a gloriously Scandinavian-looking place to stay, as I arrived at midnight following an evening flight from London. The next morning, I dragged myself out of bed for a Viking-style cooking class at Salt Eldhus where I learned to cook barley risotto and salt and pepper salmon – the perfect way, as it turned out, to fortify me for the dramatic scenery that came next. Stunning: The Gullfoss Waterfall in Pingvellir National Park is a short hop from Reykjavik. Awe-inspiring: Geysir is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air. Covered with a thick layer of snow, Pingvellir National Park sits atop the fault line that separates the American continent from the European one and provides Iceland with its volcanoes, geysers and geothermal springs. The site of Iceland’s first parliament, it’s a short hop from Geysir, where a series of geysers explode in a shower of boiling water and revolting sulphurous stench every five minutes or so. Slipping and sliding on the ice, the first explosion caught me unawares and forced me to jump back. At the next one, I held my nerve, looking smugly round at the tourists who had been caught on the hop like I had been. Then came a trip to Friðheimar, a series of greenhouses filled with tomato plants and set next to a stable crammed with hairy Icelandic ponies. The glowing buildings were an odd sight, although the produce was second to none, but even that paled in comparison to the Secret Spring – a bubbling pool flanked by a geyser and lit, on clear nights, by the shimmering green and purple glow of the Northern Lights. Sitting there, watching them ripple, was truly magical. The next morning, it was off to New York which, with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants, was a very different prospect indeed. While Iceland, like the rest of Scandinavia, boasts an effortless flair for design and a natural cool, the Big Apple has clearly worked on it. Beneath the too-cool-for-school surface, however, lies some old-fashioned Americana – not least in the all-American charm of the cheerful locals. Looking cool: Williamsburg, home to Jake Gyllenhaal among others, is awash with artisan bars. New look: Queens has had a makeover, with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars. Among them are the staff at the Roger Smith Hotel in Manhattan, who took a break from watching the Super Bowl to ply me with burgers and fries as I arrived, dishevelled, following a five-hour flight from Reykjavik. The next morning, after an all-American breakfast of bacon and waffles, I left the chintzy charms of the Roger Smith behind for a visit to MOMA, the epicentre of New York’s cultural cool. A fabulous place set in a glass and steel building over several floors, it is crammed with modern art dating from the mid-18th century onwards. Matisse, Monet and Picasso are there in numbers, as are Frieda Kahlo and Andy Warhol. Rothko, Malevich and Seurat dot its walls, as does some appalling stuff by the likes of Jean-Pierre Basquiat – avoid that and stick to the good bits on the third floor is my advice. Carrying bags of Warhol prints and a Sunday morning sized MOMA mug, we hopped into one of New York’s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low-rise Williamsburg, where another hipster favourite – craft beer – is taking hold. Beneath the pub where we ate lunch was a small collection of stills, where a variety of types, including one containing raw oysters, was being brewed. It was all delicious and a pleasant change from the Budweiser usually found in American bars. Artisan beer, artisan food and artisan art are all staples of New York’s burgeoning hipster culture, although to a cynical Brit like me, some of it felt a little try-hard. Brilliant: The Museum of Moving Image is set to become a New York must-visit - well worth going to. A case in point is the play Sleep No More, which made its début in London to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in New York. Set in a warehouse over several floors, the idea is that you walk in at an unspecified point in the play (I managed to work out that it was a version of Macbeth but not everyone does) and follow the actors around attempting to get a handle on the action. Beginning in a wonderfully old-fashioned red-velvet lined bar, the action was compered by a chap with a British accent taken from the Dick van Dyke school of acting, who showed us into a lift and provided us with Scream-style masks before throwing us into the thick of things. Moving around the huge set, I walked into scene after scene and never really got much sense of the plot, although I did find myself becoming increasingly irritated with the hammy miming. Indeed, so disjointed was Sleep No More,   $20 booklets explaining the plot were being flogged to theatregoers, who had already paid $80 to get in, on their way out. Being unable to work out what it was all about is clearly a recurrent problem. Luckily for those whose tastes don’t stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff, New York still has much to love. Along with MOMA, there’s the brilliant Museum of Moving Image in Queens which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the US’ lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces, among them the creepy doll which found fame in the Exorcist. Then there’s the bewildering selection of places to eat. In Queens alone, there’s everything from Brazilian to British and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious. And of course, there are all those iconic sights: the slow-moving Hudson River, the Rockerfeller Center, the Statue of Liberty and more. Nu York might not be to everyone’s taste but there’s no shortage of reasons to love the Big Apple – pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included.

   - The summary correctly identifies Tim Swiel as a fly-half who will join Harlequins, which aligns with the document.
   - The phrase ""recruited a new fly-half"" could imply that he is a new addition, whereas the document specifies that he is returning after a loan, which could be interpreted as a continuation rather than a new recruitment.

2. **Conclusion**: 
   - The highlighted sentence misrepresents the situation by suggesting that Harlequins have brought in a new player rather than retaining a player who was already part of the team on loan.

1222,"Sunderland are under pressure to suspend England star Adam Johnson after he was charged with grooming and three counts of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Johnson, 27, has been bailed to appear before Peterlee magistrates on May 20 — the same day Sunderland travel to Arsenal — where it is expected the case will be sent to the Crown Court. If found guilty, Johnson faces a lengthy prison term. Sunderland chiefs held talks on Thursday to decide Johnson’s future, knowing that if they suspend their top scorer he would miss the club’s remaining six games. They are just a point above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and travel to Stoke tomorrow. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity. Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him. The 27-year-old looks on during Sunderland's 1-0 Premier League win against Newcastle earlier this month. Johnson was suspended by the club after his arrest on March 2 but that was lifted when his bail was extended by five weeks a fortnight later. He returned to training under new boss Dick Advocaat and has featured as a substitute in Sunderland’s last three matches, including the 1-0 derby win over Newcastle. The suspension could now be reimposed. Johnson is accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are alleged to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. Johnson has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the same Act.

1. The document discusses Adam Johnson being charged with serious offences and mentions that Sunderland chiefs held talks to decide Johnson's future. It states that if they suspend him, he would miss the remaining games, indicating uncertainty about his position with the club.

2. The phrase ""in doubt"" suggests uncertainty, which aligns with the document's content about Sunderland's discussions regarding Johnson's future.

1222,"Sunderland are under pressure to suspend England star Adam Johnson after he was charged with grooming and three counts of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Johnson, 27, has been bailed to appear before Peterlee magistrates on May 20 — the same day Sunderland travel to Arsenal — where it is expected the case will be sent to the Crown Court. If found guilty, Johnson faces a lengthy prison term. Sunderland chiefs held talks on Thursday to decide Johnson’s future, knowing that if they suspend their top scorer he would miss the club’s remaining six games. They are just a point above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and travel to Stoke tomorrow. Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity. Johnson leaves the Peterlee police station after learning of the charges against him. The 27-year-old looks on during Sunderland's 1-0 Premier League win against Newcastle earlier this month. Johnson was suspended by the club after his arrest on March 2 but that was lifted when his bail was extended by five weeks a fortnight later. He returned to training under new boss Dick Advocaat and has featured as a substitute in Sunderland’s last three matches, including the 1-0 derby win over Newcastle. The suspension could now be reimposed. Johnson is accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences are alleged to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26. Johnson has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the same Act.

",,Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson has been charged with sexual activity with a minor according to Durham police. It is said that the footballer has been associated with a number of underage females which led to the investigation. Sunderland will however not suspend the footballer until the ongoing investigation has been completed.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document provided.

1. **Charged with sexual activity with a minor**: This is supported by the document, which states that Adam Johnson has been charged with three counts of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.

2. **According to Durham police**: The document mentions that the charges were authorized by the CPS chief Crown prosecutor for the North East following an investigation by Durham Police, so this is also supported.

3. **Associated with a number of underage females**: This statement introduces new information that is not present in the document. The document specifically mentions charges related to one girl aged 15 and does not indicate any association with multiple underage females. This could be considered a factual hallucination.

4. **Sunderland will not suspend the footballer until the ongoing investigation has been completed**: The document states that Sunderland is under pressure to suspend Johnson and that they held talks to decide his future. It does not confirm that they will wait for the investigation to be completed before making a decision on suspension. This could be seen as an intrinsic hallucination since it contradicts the implication that a suspension could be reimposed.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains hallucinated content. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"The highlighted sentence states that ""It is said that the footballer has been associated with a number of underage females which led to the investigation."" 

In the document, it specifically mentions that Adam Johnson has been charged with grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, but it does not provide any information about him being associated with multiple underage females. The document focuses on the charges against him regarding one specific girl and does not support the claim of associations with multiple underage females.

Since the highlighted sentence introduces information that is not supported by the document and cannot be inferred from it, it falls under the category of factual hallucination.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""It is said that the footballer has been associated with a number of underage females."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document discusses Adam Johnson being charged with grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. It mentions that he has been charged with specific offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, but it does not provide any information about him being associated with multiple underage females. 

2. The phrase ""It is said that"" in the isolated statement suggests that this information is based on hearsay or speculation rather than being directly supported by the document. The document does not mention any investigation into multiple underage females; it only focuses on the charges related to one specific girl.

3. Since the document does not support the claim that Johnson has been associated with a number of underage females, this statement cannot be inferred from the document.

Mackenzie Moretter, who has a rare genetic disorder called Sotos Syndrome that has delayed her development, which makes it hard for her to socialize, told her parents she wanted a 'big-girl party' for her tenth birthday. This meant inviting friends, but after her parents sent invitations to Mackenzie's classmates and heard no response, her mother Jenny Moretter took a different approach. Jenny Moretter went on Facebook and posted in a few local groups asking families with girls around Mackenzie's age to stop by their Shakopee home on Saturday - and the response was overwhelming. Scroll down for video. Mackenzie Moretter, of Shakopee, Minnesota, had a tenth birthday party on Saturday that she'll never forget after hundreds of strangers showed up to celebrate with her. Mackenzie's parents had sent out invitations to several of her fourth grade classmates, but all but a neighbor and a cousin had canceled or did not RSVP. So Mackenzie's mother went on Facebook and posted in several groups asking families with girls Mackenzie's age to stop by their family home to celebrate. 'I want so much for much for Mackenzie to belong and for her to have friends and people to accept her for who she is,' Jenny Moretter told CBS Minnesota. Mackenzie told KSMP that she is often by herself on the playground, saying that 'kids don't want to play me'. Her mother said that kids seem to like Mackenzie, but they don't seem to socialize with her. But after not getting RSVPs and having families of Mackenzie's fourth-grade classmates cancel, she wanted to do something about it.

She received an overwhelming large positive response and more than 700 people joined an event titled, 'Mackenzie's Birthday Party' Strangers of all ages showed up at a Shakopee park on Saturday to celebrate Mackenzie's tenth birthday. People came with gifts, food, chairs and even a banner that read, 'Happy Birthday Mackenzie' to be hung from the sheltered area in the park.

'I honestly thought it would be a matter of a few other moms out there who I touched their heartstrings,' she told CBS.

'Jenny was hoping to get ten girls to show up and all of a sudden this happened,' Matt Moretter told Buzzfeed. 'We had hundreds of people arrive on Saturday.' Mackenzie blew out the candles and helped her mom cut her Frozen-themed birthday cake. Cupcakes and other goodies were also supplied at the party. Shakopee Mayor issued a proclamation announcing that Saturday would be Mackenzie Moretter Day in the city, giving the girl a signed certificate of the declaration. Mackenzie made new friends of all ages throughout the day. She said before the party that kids at her school don't want to play with her so she's often by herself on the playground.

The 55-year-old newsman is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he looks to return to his post on NBC Nightly News, according to a source close to the network. It comes after it was revealed that an internal inquiry found Williams's had lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. Disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams (pictured) has threatened to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly', it has been reported. He was suspended in February with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. A source said to be close to NBC has told The New York Post how Williams 'is saying he’s not going down without a fight and (is) threatening to make it really ugly'. Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of the Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends. Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Yesterday it was reported that NBC News chief Andrew Lack wanted Williams to resume his role. But this contradicted earlier claims that NBC executives wanted Williams out and were trying to negotiate his resignation. A source told the New York Daily News 'Andy (Lack) believes viewers want him (Williams) back. 'The feeling is that (Williams') problem seems to be more with the media and other reporters than his viewers - if Andy can figure out a way to get him back on the air he will do it.' The source added that Lack 'will not make a decision about Williams' fate until the network's internal probe is complete.' On Tuesday, a report emerged in the Hollywood Reporter that Lack was in fact not convinced that Williams would be able to return. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. He is reported to have signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year.

",,"NBC anchor Brian Williams refuses to leave without a fight, threatening to expose NBC for their dirty secrets after being suspended for false reporting. Executives want him back, but he may not be able to return due to Lack's doubts.",1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The document states that Brian Williams has threatened to make his departure ""really ugly"" and is ""refusing to go down 'without a fight'."" This aligns with the summary's claim that he refuses to leave without a fight.
   - The summary mentions that he is threatening to ""expose NBC for their dirty secrets."" However, the document does not provide any information about him threatening to expose NBC or any ""dirty secrets."" This introduces a factual hallucination since it is not supported by the document.
   - The summary states that executives want him back, which is supported by the document mentioning that NBC News chief Andrew Lack wanted Williams to resume his role.
   - The summary also mentions that he may not be able to return due to Lack's doubts, which is also supported by the document stating that Lack was not convinced Williams would be able to return.

2. **Hallucination Types**:
   - The claim about threatening to expose NBC for ""dirty secrets"" is not found in the document and cannot be inferred from it, making it a factual hallucination.
   - The rest of the summary is supported by the document.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains hallucinated content due to the unverified claim about exposing NBC. Therefore, the response is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and see if the claims made in the highlighted sentence can be inferred or are directly stated.

1. **Refusal to leave without a fight**: The document states that Brian Williams is ""refusing to go down 'without a fight'"" and is ""threatening to make his departure from the channel 'really ugly'."" This part of the highlighted sentence is supported by the document.

2. **Threatening to expose NBC for their dirty secrets**: The document does not mention anything about Williams threatening to expose NBC for ""dirty secrets."" This part of the highlighted sentence introduces new information that is not present in the document, making it a factual hallucination.

3. **Suspended for false reporting**: The document confirms that Williams was suspended due to lying in his reporting, which supports this part of the highlighted sentence.

In summary, while parts of the highlighted sentence are supported by the document, the claim about threatening to expose NBC for ""dirty secrets"" is not supported and introduces new, unverifiable information. Therefore, the highlighted sentence contains hallucinations.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Brian Williams is threatening to expose NBC for their dirty secrets."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. **Context from the Document**: The document states that Brian Williams has threatened to make his departure from NBC ""really ugly"" and that he is ""refusing to go down 'without a fight'."" However, it does not specifically mention him threatening to ""expose NBC for their dirty secrets."" The phrase ""dirty secrets"" is not used in the document, and while it implies a conflict, it does not provide evidence that he is threatening to expose anything specific.

2. **Analysis of the Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement introduces the idea of ""exposing NBC for their dirty secrets,"" which is not directly supported by the document. The document discusses Williams's threats and his refusal to leave quietly, but it does not substantiate the claim that he is threatening to expose any secrets.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the isolated statement introduces a concept (exposing NBC for their dirty secrets) that is not found in the document, it can be classified as a factual hallucination. It is not directly inferable from the document's content.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [HALLUCINATED]."

1. **Child's Fall**: The summary states that the child ""slipped and fell between 10 and 12ft into the pit."" The document specifies that the child fell ""10 feet"" into the cheetah enclosure. The discrepancy in the height (10ft vs. 10-12ft) is a factual hallucination since the document provides a specific measurement.

2. **Rescue by Parents**: The summary mentions that the child was ""rescued by his parents before emergency responders arrived on the scene,"" which is supported by the document.

3. **Injuries**: The summary states that the child ""suffered from minor bruises and bumps,"" which aligns with the document that mentions ""minor bumps and bruises.""

4. **Cheetahs' Behavior**: The summary claims that ""the cheetahs seemed to ignore the boy and his parents while in the pit."" The document states that ""the cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit,"" which is consistent with the summary.

5. **Child Endangerment Charges**: The summary concludes with ""Zoo plans to press child endangerment charges,"" which is also supported by the document.

The isolated statement claims that the fall was ""between 10 and 12 feet."" However, the document only specifies a fall of ""10 feet"" and does not provide any information that supports the claim of a fall being ""between 10 and 12 feet.""

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""There was no evidence found in the house for any maltreatment of the children"" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document describes severe neglect and maltreatment of the children by Quincy Hazel and Sabrina Golden-Hazel, including locking them in a closet, forcing them to eat from a bucket, and not taking them to doctors or dentists.
2. It mentions that the couple has been charged with child neglect and that the children reported their experiences to investigators.
3. The couple's claims that they homeschooled the children and that the children made up the stories are mentioned, but the document does not provide any evidence that supports the couple's denial of maltreatment.
4. The statement in question claims that ""there was no evidence found in the house for any maltreatment of the children."" However, the document indicates that investigators did find evidence of maltreatment through the children's testimonies and the conditions they described.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement contradicts the information presented in the document, which supports the existence of maltreatment. Therefore, the isolated statement is not supported by the document.

Thus, the isolated statement is classified as [HALLUCINATED]."

1. **Claim of multiple balls**: The summary states that ""multiple balls"" were found, while the document only mentions one tennis ball that was covered in sharp pins. This introduces a factual hallucination since the document does not support the existence of multiple balls.

2. **Intentional creation**: The summary claims that the balls were ""intentionally created to harm them,"" which aligns with Tegan Peters' belief that the ball was purpose-designed to harm animals or children. This part is supported by the document.

3. **Warning the community**: The summary mentions that Tegan Peters is warning her community through social media, which is supported by the document where she shares her discovery on Facebook and with animal welfare pages.

4. **12,000 likes**: The summary accurately reflects the detail from the document about the post receiving over 12,000 likes within 12 hours, which is supported.

5. **Urgency to act**: The summary implies that neighbors have been urged to act quickly to prevent damage to their loved ones. While the document does convey concern from the community, it does not explicitly state that neighbors have been urged to act quickly, which could be seen as an extrapolation.

Given these points, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the existence of multiple balls. Therefore, the correct classification for the summary is:

The document emphasizes her shock and disgust at the discovery and her efforts to warn the community through social media.

2. **Highlighted Sentence Analysis**: The highlighted sentence states, ""Animals and children in Auckland New Zealand are at risk after a woman found multiple balls intentionally created to harm them in a local park."" 

   - **""Animals and children in Auckland New Zealand are at risk""**: This aligns with the document, as Tegan Peters expresses concern for both animals and children due to the dangerous ball she found.
   - **""after a woman found multiple balls""**: The document specifically mentions one ball, not multiple balls. This introduces a factual inaccuracy.
   - **""intentionally created to harm them in a local park""**: This part is supported by the document, as it discusses the intention behind the ball being harmful.

1. **Accident Description**: The summary states that a tragic accident occurred on the Interstate 35E in Texas last week, which is supported by the document.

2. **Damage and Injuries**: The summary mentions extensive damage to several vehicles and one woman being badly injured. The document confirms that there was a collision involving multiple vehicles and that Laura Michelle Mayeaux was injured, but it does not specify the extent of the damage or injuries to other vehicles or occupants. This could be seen as an embellishment, but it is not outright hallucinated.

3. **Eyewitness Account**: The summary correctly notes that eyewitness Jack Rivera captured the collision on his dashcam, which is supported by the document.

4. **Intoxication**: The summary states that the driver is suspected of being intoxicated at the time of the crash. The document confirms that she was found ""inebriated"" and ""smelling of alcohol,"" so this is supported.

5. **Hospitalization and Recovery**: The summary mentions that Mayeaux has been transported to a hospital for medical treatment and is expected to make a full recovery. The document states she was transported to a medical center but does not confirm her expected recovery, making this a potential factual hallucination.

6. **Ongoing Investigation**: The summary states that the investigation into the incident is ongoing, which is supported by the document.
