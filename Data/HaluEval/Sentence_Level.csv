1,"At first glance, the ingredients might look pretty normal: dates, sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and chocolate. But the last step of the recipe for the Jungle Bar might leave you a little squeamish: cricket flour, which is essentially crickets ground up into a powder. The bar itself is claimed to be a good source of iron and protein - owing to the crickets - but whether you’ll want to bite into one is another matter. Scroll down for video. An Icelandic duo has created a snack that is made using cricket flour. Called the Jungle Bar it also contains dates, sesame seeds and chocolate. Cricket flour is said to be a good source of protein and other nutrients. The duo hopes it will encourage people in the West to eat more insects. The Jungle Bar is being developed by Icelandic duo Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson and Stefán Atli Thoroddsen through their company Crowbar Protein. On Kickstarter they are seeking £10,000 ($15,000) for the insect-powered protein bar. They previously rose to fame with their Fly Factory, a micro-factory that used larvae to create foods including chocolate cake and pâté. Ingredients. Dates, sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, chocolate and cricket flour. Nutrition information. The bar is 50 grams (1.7 ounces), 200 calories, contains 8 grams of high quality protein (16 per cent of the bar) and has a shelf life of 1 year. The duo say that insects are a largely untapped source of nutrients in the Western world, and they hope their product could spark a change in diet habits. To make the bar, the team has cricket flour sent in, from farm-raised crickets that have been ground down. It is then mixed with the other ingredients to make the unusual bar. Cricket flour is useful because it contains a lot of minerals, vitamins and nutrients that are essential for the human body. It has a high protein content, and it’s full of iron, calcium, B-12 vitamin, and omega-3 and 6.

The team expects to begin shipping in August 2015. ‘We see Jungle Bar playing a big part in a food revolution, towards a more conscious era of food, where edible insects are a big part of our diets,’ said Mr Aðalsteinsson in a video. The Jungle Bar is also free from gluten, peanuts, dairy and soy. ‘Insects are an excellent source of protein, good fats, minerals and vitamins,’ the team said on their Kickstarter page. ‘In fact, they give us exactly what we want in a healthy and nutritious lifestyle, that's why we use edible insects in Jungle Bar. ‘It's a great alternative to other protein rich foods, and much more sustainable!’ If you want to try a Jungle Bar for yourself, you can buy a box of six on Kickstarter for £17 ($25). The team expects to begin shipping in August 2015. Last year the duo unveiled their Fly Factory (pictured) that breeds insect larvae for human consumption. Using the micro-factory they created larvae pâté and a coconut-choclate flavoured dessert, and they said the project could be used to help alleviate global food shortages.

2,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his players to shut the Champions League out of their minds and concentrate on extending their lead at the top of the La Liga table on Saturday. Victory over fourth-placed Valencia will take Enrique's men at least temporarily five points clear at the top of the table with title rivals Real Madrid not kicking off against Malaga until evening. But with Valencia visiting the Nou Camp in the midst of a 10-match unbeaten run Enrique has stressed the importance of forgetting Wednesday night's superb 3-1 semi-final first leg win in Paris. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his side to switch their attention back to the La Liga title race. Luis Suarez starred in Barcelona's 3-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain by bagging a brace. Barcelona midfielder Andreas Iniesta has been ruled out of his side's league encounter against Valencia. Enrique said: 'We are not thinking about the PSG match, we are only thinking about the visit of Valencia. 'Mentally we will have no problems because the players know if they are not 100 per cent against Valencia things will get complicated, but physically there are one or two things we have to assess.' Andreas Iniesta is definitely ruled out for Barca after he was forced off early in the second half of the 3-1 win in the French capital with a bruised pelvis. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he was impressed but undaunted by Barca's performance over PSG as his side look to pull off a shock win which will strengthen their grip on fourth place. Santo said: 'What we have seen confirms what we already thought. They are a great team with great players. They don't have many weaknesses, but they do have some.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga. Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico. Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco is expected to replace the injured Benzema for Saturday's clash. Malaga pulled off a stunning 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp in June and Ancelotti has warned his players they must wipe thoughts of their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico if they are to avoid a similar fate. Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality. They beat Barcelona at home and we need to focus on this match in order to win it.' Atletico Madrid will look to consolidate their grip on third place as they travel to a Deportivo La Coruna side for whom two successive draws has left them sitting above the relegation zone on goal difference alone. James Rodriguez (left) is likely to play in a central attacking role alongside club team-mate Isco. Gareth Bale (pictured) and Cristiano Ronaldo will be tasked with scoring goals in Benzema's absence. Bale sprints ahead of Luka Modric during Friday's training session ahead of Real's clash against Malaga. Also on Saturday, mid-table Athletic Bilbao look to return to winning ways after three games without a victory as they take on Getafe, for whom three games unbeaten have effectively ended relegation fears. Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal. Celta Vigo travel to Eibar while the Monday match sees Elche look to ease relegation fears at home to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.

At a visit to the Age UK in Plymouth yesterday, David Cameron appeared weary with bags under his eyes and disheveled hair. In one day this week the Tory leader travelled to all all four home nations in his bid to secure votes ahead of the May 7 election. Scroll down for video. Showing the strain: At a visit to the Age UK in Plymouth yesterday, David Cameron appeared weary with bags under his eyes and disheveled hair. He has also had to wade into a number of arguments, defending outspoken ministers, and even got into a muddle over cream teas. On Thursday Mr Cameron was been forced to defend Michael Fallon after the defence secretary claimed Ed Miliband would stab Britain’s national interest in the back in the same way he did his brother to gain the Labour leadership. The Prime Minister was also dealt a blow as Ed Miliband overtook him as the most popular political leader for the first time. In a shock result that sent shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. Not impressed: Six-year-old Lucy Howarth looked positively uninterested as the Prime Minister read a story at Sacred Heart Primary School near Bolton earlier this week. The Labour Party also took a commanding four point lead over the Tories, according to the pollsters Survation. On Wednesday, Mr Cameron failed to get the desired response from a six-year-old schoolgirl who looked positively uninterested as he read a story to her classmates at Sacred Heart Primary School near Bolton. Yesterday, another campaign gaffe saw Mr Cameron wade into the Cornwall Devon debate about how to eat a scone - getting the two counties contrasting traditions mixed up. The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority. But his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of Tea by the Taw on The Strand in Barnstaple, the North Devon Gazette reported. David Cameron, on a visit to Devon this morning, made the blunder of confusing the two methods for eating a cream tea. All good politicians know how to make small talk with voters, but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter. In an attempt to woo the locals, Mr Cameron ventured: 'When you are in Devon you do the jam and the cream in a different order to Cornwall, is that right?' Sensing a gaffe was imminent, he went on: 'I'm going to get this wrong, aren't I?' His prediction was correct, as he added: 'In Devon it's... jam first and cream on top?' His comments were greeted with silence and stony faces, as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the Prime Minister right.

Suarez’s record in his last 10 games is nine goals and four assists. He has also created 20 chances in that time and when he scores Barcelona always win.

He is 35 after all.’ Luis Enrique’s name was also chanted and he joked: ‘It is always the same 150 supporters that do that, I pay them.’The Barcelona coach was asked for his favourite goal of the six. ‘All of them’ he said. ‘I am struggling to remember any game with so many beautiful goals.’
",,"Neymar, Luis Suarez, and Lionel Messi have collaborated to score a combined total of 150 goals in the current Barcelona season, making it the best attacking team in the club's history. Messi and Suarez both scored hat tricks in Tuesday night's game against Getafe, while Neymar added two more to give Barcelona a 9-0 victory. The team's success has been due, in part, to the impressive skills of Xavi, who has played exceptionally well this season and is a fan favorite.",1,1,1,1,1
7,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to speak Wednesday to a joint meeting of Congress. The address marks the first time in history that the head of the Japanese government will address the entire U.S. Congress, and given the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship, it is an invitation long overdue. So far, Prime Minister Abe's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month's speech to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This is not surprising; in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center nearly three-quarters of the respondents indicated they had ""never heard of"" Shinzo Abe, underscoring just how difficult it is for the Obama administration to sell its much-vaunted ""pivot"" or ""rebalance"" to the American public. Nevertheless, Abe arrives in Washington at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the ""pivot,"" the Trans-Pacific Partnership Free Trade Agreement, or TPP. The TPP is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific-facing nations -- combined, these countries account for 40% of global GDP.  And beyond its potential economic impact, it also allows the United States to expand its influence in Asia, providing an alternative to China-centered agreements such as the Regional Cooperative Economic Partnership. The stakes, therefore, are significant. But so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret. Prominent Democrats such as Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, have been critical of the TPP, arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine U.S. sovereignty. But the immediate battle in Congress is not over the TPP directly, but something called trade promotion authority, or ""Fast-Track.""  Trade promotion authority, which would allow trade agreements such as the TPP to come before Congress without amendment, has been on the books for decades.  The power to use trade promotion authority, however, must be periodically reauthorized.  Congress voted narrowly to give President Bush trade promotion authority in 2002, but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed. There is near universal agreement that the current talks cannot be concluded unless the Congress reauthorizes trade promotion authority, without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks cannot be confident that the United States speaks with one voice. Republicans control both houses of Congress, and are generally supportive of free trade. But while passage of trade promotion authority in the Senate is likely, the result in the House, where Abe will be speaking, is less certain.  This is in part because some House Republicans are simply loath to delegate any power to the President, while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016.  After all, the fact that Republicans would actually be supporting the proposal of a Democratic President will not prevent Democrats -- and their labor supporters -- from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for Republicans among those white, working-class voters who were so crucial to Republican success in the 2014 midterm. But even if trade promotion authority passes, the fight over the TPP is far from over.  Provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before Congress can grant final approval to the TPP.  This likely throws the TPP vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race. Ironically, the fact that Democrats seem likely to nominate Hillary Clinton, an early supporter of the TPP, may go a long way to blunting this attack.  Still, it is hard to see House Republicans willing to ""go it alone"" on the TPP without some Democratic buy-in. Which brings us back to Prime Minister Abe's speech. Given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, there will be an understandable focus on what the Prime Minister says regarding his nation's role in that conflict. In the eyes of many in China and South Korea, Japan has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions, while the United States itself expressed disappointment over a visit Abe made to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. Yet despite such criticisms, a Pew poll found a plurality in the United States thinks that the apologies that Japan has issued in the past about the war are sufficient. As a result, for much of the U.S. audience, Abe's words about the TPP will be of equal importance to questions of history. So, what will the Prime Minister say, and will his support for TPP be enough to sway Congress? Certainly, Abe has a lot riding on the agreement domestically; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse. This suggests that the big challenge for Abe on Wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the TPP in a way that convinces the American people that the trade agreement is not about enriching U.S. corporations and outsourcing U.S. jobs, but strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the United States and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of China. It's a tall task, especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech. But it's a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand, but for the success of President Obama's pivot to Asia. And with that in mind, Prime Minister Abe won't be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on Wednesday.

But the real mystery is how the robot’s head can move independently but stay on top of the free-rolling ball. It’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘stick’ the droid’s head to its body, but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness. It could be that the droid’s head is a separate robot with its own set of remote controls, enabling it to ‘look’ around. It's currently a mystery as to how BB-8 moves, but its white and orange case may hide a larger mechanism like that found in Sphero, which allows it to move quickly in any direction.

Magnets may still be used to keep the head in contact with the body. Professor Stewart said: ‘The floating ‘head’ is probably on rollers magnetically bound through the plastic ball to the ""driving"" robot inside.’ He explained that rare earth magnets are very strong and light and the robot’s ‘movements are consistent with this, such as a tendency to move in the direction of travel.’ ‘The inside and head could be wirelessly linked but given that this robot is radio controlled rather than autonomous…I suspect that head and body are just independently radio controlled.’ It’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘stick’ the droid’s head to its body (pictured), but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness.

A counterweight gets the ball rolling on demand and sensors allow users to control the direction and speed of the ball. The wheels inside work like a hamster running inside a ball and never leave Sphero's surface, so it can turn corners at high speed. There are up to 30 games available via apps including driving, sports and arcade games, and the polycarbonate ball could soon be on its way to school classrooms to give children an insight into robotics. It is hoped the waterproof ball will inspire a future generation to get involved in computer science and design and technology.

9,"Britain's only surviving mobile cinema has gone on sale for £120,000 as the owners who spent years of their life restoring it and touring the country now want to enjoy parenthood. Emma Giffard, 36, and Ollie Halls, 37, from Somerset, bought the cinema for just £1,200 in 2005 and spent £35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in Devon over five years. They toured the country with the classic bus which became a celebrity, starring alongside Melvyn Bragg in a 20-part BBC2 series 'The Reel History of Britain and in 'George Clarke's Amazing Spaces'. Restored: Britain's last-ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005. But now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus, which has taken over their lives for more than a decade. 'We've got two children under three,' Emma said. 'Sometimes my mother-in-law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we're on but it's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger.' After years on the road, the couple had their first baby Iona May Giffard Halls in 2012 and five months ago, they're second arrived, Ivy. Since then, Ollie has had to spend five months a year on tour while Emma stays at home with the children and he's now looking forward to having more time with Iona and Ivy. Love affair: Emma and Ollie outside the Bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago. Iona May Giffar Halls, two and a half years old, sits outside the mobile cinema. Her parents are looking to offload the classic so they can concentrate on being parents to her and sister Ivy, five months old. Dad Ollie doesn't want to be on tour as they grow up. Happy families: Mum Emma with Iona May, left, and Ivy, right. The family have just bough they're first home in Somerset. 'I'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if I didn't give it up, I'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus.' It's now listed on eBay for £120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for, but it's not just a bus, it's a piece of British history, listed as 'the soul survivor' of the original fleet. It's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967, to promote British industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation. With a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a Tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside, the Bedford SB3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the 'white heat of technology'. The vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967. A piece of history: This was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote British industry in the 1960s. Super seven: The vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in Essex where it sat for 14 years. Promoting industry: Bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the 'white heat of technology' But like all modern creations, soon enough they grew old and it wasn't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten. It was owned by the Transport Trust between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in Essex for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in Somerset. In 2005, Ollie Halls and Emma Giffard of the Vintage Mobile Cinema Company bought it for just £1,200 and brought it to Devon, where they carefully restored it with the help of friends. They spent £35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at North Devon schools and villages and beyond. From there it went on to exhibit at film festivals, community, corporate and private events around the UK and abroad, travelling as far as Holland and France. Listed: The rare Bedford mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on eBay for £120,000. Oliver and Emma are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain. Ollie said: 'It could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad, someone wanting to run the business, or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust. 'I really want it to continue to be out there for people to be able to carry on sharing the experience. 'But we have to decide what route is going to best secure its future, because it's completely unique and owning it means that we're custodians of that little bit of history. Government property: The fleet of Bedford SB3s as they were when they toured the country promoting industry in the 1960s. 'It was never meant to be a career - I just started doing it up as a hobby and it got out of control. 'I was working full time and spending all my spare time and spare money on the bus, lying in the mud in a freezing cold shed wondering if I'd gone mad. 'But people just loved everything about it, which made all the blood, sweat and tears worthwhile. 'They don't make things like this anymore, and it speaks to people's sense of nostalgia. 'It was so popular that it absolutely and 100 per cent took over my life - and it's been hard to give up to because so many people still want the bus.' There's also a new edition which could be a different opportunity to a new owner. The vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years. Re-united: The owners got a call 'out of the blue'  from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years. Now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner. 'We got a phone call out the blue,' said Ollie. 'Someone saw us on the news and realised that the trailer their friend had been using as a woodwork shop belonged with our cinema. 'It's taken a few years but we've finally put them back together.' Ollie had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it, it's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus. 'It's a huge restoration which I don't think I want to do because I have a number of other projects that I'm hoping to work on. 'We've just bought our first house in Somerset which is a restoration project and I've also got a 1940s caravan and another 1960s Bedford truck to work on.

9,"Britain's only surviving mobile cinema has gone on sale for £120,000 as the owners who spent years of their life restoring it and touring the country now want to enjoy parenthood. Emma Giffard, 36, and Ollie Halls, 37, from Somerset, bought the cinema for just £1,200 in 2005 and spent £35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in Devon over five years. They toured the country with the classic bus which became a celebrity, starring alongside Melvyn Bragg in a 20-part BBC2 series 'The Reel History of Britain and in 'George Clarke's Amazing Spaces'. Restored: Britain's last-ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005. But now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus, which has taken over their lives for more than a decade. 'We've got two children under three,' Emma said. 'Sometimes my mother-in-law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we're on but it's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger.' After years on the road, the couple had their first baby Iona May Giffard Halls in 2012 and five months ago, they're second arrived, Ivy. Since then, Ollie has had to spend five months a year on tour while Emma stays at home with the children and he's now looking forward to having more time with Iona and Ivy. Love affair: Emma and Ollie outside the Bedford cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago. Iona May Giffar Halls, two and a half years old, sits outside the mobile cinema. Her parents are looking to offload the classic so they can concentrate on being parents to her and sister Ivy, five months old. Dad Ollie doesn't want to be on tour as they grow up. Happy families: Mum Emma with Iona May, left, and Ivy, right. The family have just bough they're first home in Somerset. 'I'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if I didn't give it up, I'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus.' It's now listed on eBay for £120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for, but it's not just a bus, it's a piece of British history, listed as 'the soul survivor' of the original fleet. It's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967, to promote British industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation. With a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a Tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside, the Bedford SB3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the 'white heat of technology'. The vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the Ministry of Technology in 1967. A piece of history: This was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote British industry in the 1960s. Super seven: The vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in Essex where it sat for 14 years. Promoting industry: Bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the 'white heat of technology' But like all modern creations, soon enough they grew old and it wasn't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten. It was owned by the Transport Trust between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in Essex for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in Somerset. In 2005, Ollie Halls and Emma Giffard of the Vintage Mobile Cinema Company bought it for just £1,200 and brought it to Devon, where they carefully restored it with the help of friends. They spent £35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at North Devon schools and villages and beyond. From there it went on to exhibit at film festivals, community, corporate and private events around the UK and abroad, travelling as far as Holland and France. Listed: The rare Bedford mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on eBay for £120,000. Oliver and Emma are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain. Ollie said: 'It could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad, someone wanting to run the business, or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust. 'I really want it to continue to be out there for people to be able to carry on sharing the experience. 'But we have to decide what route is going to best secure its future, because it's completely unique and owning it means that we're custodians of that little bit of history. Government property: The fleet of Bedford SB3s as they were when they toured the country promoting industry in the 1960s. 'It was never meant to be a career - I just started doing it up as a hobby and it got out of control. 'I was working full time and spending all my spare time and spare money on the bus, lying in the mud in a freezing cold shed wondering if I'd gone mad. 'But people just loved everything about it, which made all the blood, sweat and tears worthwhile. 'They don't make things like this anymore, and it speaks to people's sense of nostalgia. 'It was so popular that it absolutely and 100 per cent took over my life - and it's been hard to give up to because so many people still want the bus.' There's also a new edition which could be a different opportunity to a new owner. The vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years. Re-united: The owners got a call 'out of the blue'  from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years. Now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner. 'We got a phone call out the blue,' said Ollie. 'Someone saw us on the news and realised that the trailer their friend had been using as a woodwork shop belonged with our cinema. 'It's taken a few years but we've finally put them back together.' Ollie had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it, it's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus. 'It's a huge restoration which I don't think I want to do because I have a number of other projects that I'm hoping to work on. 'We've just bought our first house in Somerset which is a restoration project and I've also got a 1940s caravan and another 1960s Bedford truck to work on. 'I'm the kind of guy who likes a challenge but I feel like the bus is done now and I want to work on something new - I've been doing it most of my adult life. 'They drive beautifully together but the trailer is another restoration project - maybe this time for someone else.'

10,"London (CNN)British police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of London's jewelry district said Friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but didn't respond. Southern Monitoring Alarm Company called the Metropolitan Police Service, also known as Scotland Yard, at 12:21 a.m. April 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd., MPS said in a prepared statement. ""The call was recorded and transferred to the police's CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system,"" the statement said. ""A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. This investigation is being carried out locally. ""It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident."" The theft was so big that police haven't come up with a value for what was stolen. Over the four-day Easter holiday, thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to £200 million, or $300 million, in a remark widely reported by news media. Numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. The British tabloid The Daily Mirror claimed Friday to have obtained closed-circuit TV footage that captured the robbery being carried out. The video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered. They carried large bags, what looked like drill equipment and other tools, then exited with trash bins. Toward the end of the video, a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins. British police told CNN they have not released any video of the heist. When asked about the video published by the Daily Mirror, police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the Hatton Garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video. The Daily Mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days. The Mirror's time stamps, which CNN has not been able to independently verify, show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on Thursday. If the footage, and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct, at least six people were involved in the heist. Just four minutes later, the first of the thieves, nicknamed ""Mr. Ginger"" by the newspaper for his red hair, appears in the building holding a black bag. He goes downstairs toward the vault. At 9:27 p.m., a street camera shows a white Ford Transit van pulling up to an alley beside the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building. Men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away, leaving the men behind. Inside the building, at 9:30p.m., the camera records a thief nicknamed ""The Gent"" for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled ""Gas"" on the back. A minute later, ""Mr. Strong"" appears, wearing a builder's hat and carrying steel supports, which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault. At 9:36 p.m., Mr. Strong and a thief nicknamed Mr. Montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins, one of which might have contained, according the Mirror, the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault. It is unclear, but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault. At any rate, according to the Daily Mirror, no more activity is seen above ground until Friday morning, shortly before 8:00. The white van returns, is loaded in two minutes, and drives off again. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ginger returns, two days after he was first seen. The newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack. He goes downstairs toward the vault. Saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the Tall Man, who helped carry some of the loot out of the building. Early Sunday, Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and a robber nicknamed the Old Man are seen to be active. The Tall Man and the Old Man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside. The Old Man leans on the bin, struggling for breath, and reveals the side of his face to the camera. A white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it, including several trash bins. Three men get into the white van and, at 6:44 a.m. they are gone. The heist would not be reported to police for two more days, on Tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work. Police said Thursday there was no sign of forced entry. Johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists. Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the United Kingdom capable of pulling it off. He said he had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, ""whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation."" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to ""the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK"" and has been for quite some time.

11,"The Kevin Pietersen camp have scored a comprehensive win in the PR battle with the England and Wales Cricket Board without calling on any outside assistance. It has been assumed that the way KP outplayed the ECB's army of media personnel at every turn was because his agents, Mission Sports Management, had expert help guiding their strategy. But agent Adam Wheatley, co-founder of the company with Sir Ian Botham, insists that everything has been done in-house since the brief involvement of former Sun editor David Yelland during KP's supposed reintegration into the England team in 2012. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey in The Parks as he bids to earn a recall to the England squad. Wheatley said: 'We have just sat down together as a team with Kevin and planned the best way forward. It does help on social media that KP has a Twitter following of nearly 2.5million. 'And the ECB have totally misread the situation. You can't just keep briefing against someone. There are always two sides to a story and I think people now realise this.'

Among the many issues that the ECB must sort out when writing a job description for their new director of cricket is what exactly Andy Flower is doing to earn £300,000-a-year as technical director of elite coaching — the same amount he pocketed when in supreme control of the England team. Also, his current title does not differ a great deal from the 'director of cricket' the ECB want to appoint and could easily lead to confusion over who is responsible for what. Ridiculously, Flower was kept on by the ECB on huge money — basically as a thank you for services rendered — when there should have been a clean break after the Ashes humiliation Down Under.

Under existing rules, the SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds from the six play-off ties for redistribution among the clubs. But a bid by the league board to force play-off finalists to charge all fans a minimum price of Â£15 for the play-off ties was withdrawn at a meeting last Thursday.

Last week, a resolution by Hibs and Motherwell to have the 50-per-cent levy on play-off gates cut in half was defeated. Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor. Accused of a cash grab to keep more of the play-off cash, Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor for the last two seasons.

14,"The Married at First Sight star who tried to leave her groom at the altar after deciding he was too ‘unattractive’ for her has finally admitted to having romantic feelings towards him. While the honeymoon period comes to an end for the couples on tonight's episode of the hit FYI reality series, as they all return home to celebrate the holidays with their spouses, whom they've known for a total of seven days, it seems that, for Jaclyn Methuen and Ryan Ranellone, the romance has only just begun. 'Day one, I was freaking out. Day seven, oh man, I have a crush on my husband,' 30-year-old Jaclyn says in a preview for the latest episode. Scroll down for video. Falling in love: Jaclyn Methuen caresses her new husband Ryan Ranellone's chin while lying in bed together on tonight's episode of Married at First Sight. Euphoric feeling: The 30-year-old is all smiles as she admits that she is developing a crush on her new husband. Meanwhile, Ryan tells the cameras that he remains dedicated to cultivating a real relationship with his new wife, whom he has been attracted to from day one. 'I am committed to making our marriage work,' the 29-year-old says. And, thankfully, after a week of awkward encounters and terse conversations, it looks like things are starting to take a turn for the better for the newlyweds. After being single for seven years, Jaclyn started their union by keeping Ryan at arm’s length and subconsciously putting him in the 'friend zone' throughout their honeymoon in Puerto Rico, with Ryan admitting in last week’s episode that that he was growing increasingly irritated with her insistence on calling him 'dude' and 'bro' when they were supposed to be acting like a married couple. Making it work: The couple share a laugh after they return home from their honeymoon in Puerto Rico. But it looks like the sales rep from Union, New Jersey, is finally seeing her spouse in a new light. As well as Jaclyn’s long-awaited confession about her romantic feelings for her husband, the preview clip also shows the couple laughing in bed together as she gently caresses his chin. Interestingly enough, while Jaclyn and Ryan initially appeared to be the couple with the most problems, but they are growing ever closer to one another – while the other newlyweds seem to be growing apart. Jessica Castro, 30, and Ryan DeNiro, 29, who were comfortable with each other from the start, spent the end of their honeymoon arguing over his choice of words during what should have been a romantic dinner date in Key Largo. During last week's episode, Jessica showed her new husband a photo of herself with her 'Monroe' lip piercing and was furious with his reaction, accusing him of calling it trashy. Growing together: Davina Kullar and Sean Varricchio hold hands as they return home from their romantic honeymoon in Colorado. Marriage woes: Ryan DeNiro and Jessica Castro are still going through a rough patch after he allegedly called her 'Monroe' lip-piercing 'trashy' last week. 'You just don't say that to a person,' she told him over dinner, and Ryan soon stormed out of the restaurant. And it looks like the two are still struggling to reconnect. While Jessica tells the cameras that things are 'really weird' between them, Ryan admits that he has a side of himself that 'sometimes isn't too pleasant'. 'I feel like I have to walk on egg shells around him,' Jessica adds. Meanwhile, Davina Kullar, 34, and Sean Varricchio, 35, appear to be moving forward with their marriage as they continue to build an emotional bond. 'We just got back from the honeymoon and the real life part of [marriage] really does begin,' she says of their whirlwind union.
","Jaclyn Methuen and Ryan Ranellone return home for the holidays after their honeymoon in Puerto Rico on tonight's episode of the reality show. The 30-year-old, from Union, New Jersey, nearly left her new husband at the altar because she wasn't physically attracted to him.

Euphoric feeling: The 30-year-old is all smiles as she admits that she is developing a crush on her new husband. Meanwhile, Ryan tells the cameras that he remains dedicated to cultivating a real relationship with his new wife, whom he has been attracted to from day one. 'I am committed to making our marriage work,' the 29-year-old says. And, thankfully, after a week of awkward encounters and terse conversations, it looks like things are starting to take a turn for the better for the newlyweds. After being single for seven years, Jaclyn started their union by keeping Ryan at arm’s length and subconsciously putting him in the 'friend zone' throughout their honeymoon in Puerto Rico, with Ryan admitting in last week’s episode that that he was growing increasingly irritated with her insistence on calling him 'dude' and 'bro' when they were supposed to be acting like a married couple. Making it work: The couple share a laugh after they return home from their honeymoon in Puerto Rico. But it looks like the sales rep from Union, New Jersey, is finally seeing her spouse in a new light. As well as Jaclyn’s long-awaited confession about her romantic feelings for her husband, the preview clip also shows the couple laughing in bed together as she gently caresses his chin. Interestingly enough, while Jaclyn and Ryan initially appeared to be the couple with the most problems, but they are growing ever closer to one another – while the other newlyweds seem to be growing apart. Jessica Castro, 30, and Ryan DeNiro, 29, who were comfortable with each other from the start, spent the end of their honeymoon arguing over his choice of words during what should have been a romantic dinner date in Key Largo. During last week's episode, Jessica showed her new husband a photo of herself with her 'Monroe' lip piercing and was furious with his reaction, accusing him of calling it trashy. Growing together: Davina Kullar and Sean Varricchio hold hands as they return home from their romantic honeymoon in Colorado. Marriage woes: Ryan DeNiro and Jessica Castro are still going through a rough patch after he allegedly called her 'Monroe' lip-piercing 'trashy' last week. 'You just don't say that to a person,' she told him over dinner, and Ryan soon stormed out of the restaurant. And it looks like the two are still struggling to reconnect. While Jessica tells the cameras that things are 'really weird' between them, Ryan admits that he has a side of himself that 'sometimes isn't too pleasant'. 'I feel like I have to walk on egg shells around him,' Jessica adds. Meanwhile, Davina Kullar, 34, and Sean Varricchio, 35, appear to be moving forward with their marriage as they continue to build an emotional bond. 'We just got back from the honeymoon and the real life part of [marriage] really does begin,' she says of their whirlwind union.

15,"With a 'megadrought' forecast to hit the US in the coming decades, parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs. Arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the Rockies and seeding the sky with silver iodide. They hope the technology will allow them to mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change – but not everyone is convinced. With a 'megadrought' forecast to hit the US in the coming decades, parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs. Arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the Rockies, and seeding the sky with silver iodide. The process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the General Electric labs in Schenectady, New York. Two decades later, the Central Arizona Project and the Salt River Project invested in research to make it a reality. 'It hasn't been taken off the table as a potential tool as we work our way through drought now and in the future,' Nancy Selover, Arizona's state climatologist told Becky Brisley at Cronkite News. Since 2007, CAP has put about $1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the Colorado River system. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice. If it seems like it never stops raining, blame the Russians. Or even the North Koreans. CIA chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world's weather, a conference heard in February. A leading academic told how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding. Professor Alan Robock, from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: 'Consultants working for the CIA rang and said we'd like to know if someone is controlling the world's climate would we know about it? 'Of course they were also asking - if we control someone else's climate would they then know about it.' The professor is one of many scientists from around the world are actively looking at manipulating the weather as a way of combating climate change. Professor Robock told the callers that any attempts to meddle with the weather on a large scale would be detectable. The system works on the premise that rainfall takes place when supercooled droplets of water form ice crystals. As a result they become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, and fall, often melting on their way down to form rain. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by seeding the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice. They create rain by inducing nucleation – a process in which water is in the air condenses around the particles and crystallises to form ice. But some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins, as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water. Compared to other alternatives, such as desalinating seawater, cloud seeding is the cheapest option, though it isn't going to be a drought-buster on its own. In a recent Wyoming Weather Modification pilot project, the technology resulted in an increase of seasonal snow water accumulations of 5 to 15 per cent. But Selover, the state climatologist, told Cronkite News that the trickiest part of cloud seeding is measuring whether an area got more rainfall. 'So the effectiveness of it is in doubt,' she said. 'It's not that it's completely ineffective – they're pretty sure it has some impact – but it's pretty hard to measure.' Some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins, as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water. Pictured is Lake Powell, near Page, Arizona.

16,"Wladimir Klitschko has reached rare territory among heavyweight champions. Now, in his ninth year as champion, Klitschko is catching Joe Louis and Larry Holmes in successful defences. When Klitschko faces Bryant Jennings on April 25 at New York's Madison Square Garden, he will risk his heavyweight belt for the 18th time. A win over Jennings will place Klitschko within one successful defense of Holmes but he would still need six additional wins to match Louis' record of 25. Wladimir Klitschko works out in the ring in front of the media ahead of his fight against Bryant Jennings. Klitschko lands a right hand during a sparring session in front of the watching media in Florida. 'With all respect to Louis and Larry Holmes, they're icons for me, I don't want to be compared with them because they are fighters I always have looked up to,' Klitschko said. 'As an outsider (media) can observe the fights and title defenses, you keep track. I'm an insider.' Nonetheless, Klitschko has made deep inroads during his second heavyweight stint that began with a seventh-round technical knockout win over Chris Byrd for a sanctioning body title in April 2006. Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson never enjoyed a title run as long as the native of Ukraine and part-time Hollywood, Florida resident. 'My mind is in a tunnel; I'm getting ready for the next bout,' Klitschko said. 'And I'm excited about the challenge. I do not compare myself with the records of those guys - Joe Louis and Larry Holmes. I just enjoy my game.' Klitschko built the impressive streak of title defences at a time when American heavyweights have faded from contention. Until Deontay Wilder's victory over Bermane Stiverne on January 17, no American held a piece of the heavyweight title since 2006. Klitschko is closing in on the record number of defences of the heavyweight title set by Joe Louis. Victory for the Ukrainian will take him to within one win of Larry Holmes' 19 defences. Wilder looks for a lengthy reign while Jennings, of Philadelphia, seeks to tilt the division's power more toward to its once-dominant base. 'Every opponent is different and we will see how Bryant Jennings can hold the pressure,' Klitschko said. 'As my former coach, Emmanuel Steward said, `on fight night, when you step into the ring, welcome to big time boxing.' 'How is Bryant Jennings going to hold to big-time boxing and get along with that? We'll see.' Jennings earned the opportunity to face Klitschko after his split-decision victory over fellow contender Mike Perez last July. 'Bryant Jennings is going to bring a lot of excitement and a lot of energy into the ring,' Klitschko said. 'This fight is going to be nothing but exciting.' Jennings defends his unbeaten record when he takes on Klitschko later this month in New York. Klitschko is keen to face Deontay Wilder (left) in a unification clash later in his career. Klitschko believes boxing is enjoying a revival. Attention toward the sport has increased with the build-up to the mega-fight between welterweight champions Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2 in Las Vegas. And Klitschko also predicts a future unification bout between him and Wilder would be appealing to fight fans that distanced themselves from the heavyweight division after Tyson's retirement. 'The demand is shifting back and forth and during the time when boxing was less popular in the heavyweight division, because of the lack of good (American) prospects, it shifted to Europe,' said Klitschko, who will make his first US appearance in seven years. 'You cannot say boxing was dead or unpopular. The attention shifted to different continents. And now the demand for boxing is big and I'm really excited to be back in the States. 'I believe Deontay is an extremely talented athlete. We've sparred enough that we know each other well. I believe a unification fight is something the public wants.'

Thale's job normally requires him to walk the streets of the city he has called home for the past few years. But at the moment, he says, this is not an option. Because he is simply too afraid. The reason is a wave of anti-immigrant violence that has swept the country in recent days, leaving several dead as authorities scrambled to detain those responsible and prevent further bloodshed. The cause of this surge in violence is murky, with some blaming alleged inflammatory comments about foreign nationals from the Zulu king, local media reported, others saying a labor dispute between locals and foreigners back in March turned nasty. Unemployment in impoverished areas has also been a factor. The violence has caused thousands of immigrants to seek refuge at police stations and shelters. Thale fears he'll be attacked if he goes to work. ""I'm scared to go to town because I do not know when these people can attack and it's stressful for me,"" he told CNN. ""We're close to month end -- how am I going to pay the rent and feed my wife?"" CNN spoke to several immigrants living and working in South Africa about the crisis, which has caused South African President Jacob Zuma to postpone an overseas visit and left authorities scrambling to prevent further clashes. On Tuesday the country's Defense Minister said South Africa would deploy troops to areas where police spread too thin in order to halt the attacks. Zimbabwe immigrant Stanley Ndlovu says he is so frightened he dare not venture outside, not even to go to the local mall. He works in Johannesburg as a cleaner and gardener, and also runs a small tuck shop where workers can buy food and basic supplies at his place of work. It's a role he hears many South Africans say should belong to them alone. He feels the South African government has been far too slow to respond to the violence, which has erupted intermittently in various cities over the past few years. ""To stop violence they need to arrest and sentence the perpetrators,"" he says. Meanwhile, Eric Kalonji left the Democratic Republic of Congo and arrived in the South African capital in 2012, working as a waiter until the restaurant he worked at closed in January. Now devoting himself to his studies in New Zealand, he feels that the situation in South Africa is more complex than a simple case of ""us versus them."" He believes the blame lies heavily on what he calls the government's failure to provide its people with jobs and education. ""This xenophobia thing is the result of a deeper malaise (in) South Africans"" he says.

But one neighbour was furious with the proposals, claiming it 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. Another Beckham victory: David and Victoria have won a planning battle against their next-door neighbour over proposals to install air-conditioning at their new mansion in west London. Portfolio: The couple, pictured, have won planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence. They already have homes in California, France and Dubai. The neighbour expressed 'deep concerns' about the impact of noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from the construction. But other locals gave their support to the Beckhams and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council has approved the plans subject to minor conditions. A report from the council said the air-conditioning would have minimal impact on the significance of the listed building and the noise from the units would comply with the borough's criteria. Jonathan Bore, the executive director for planning and development, said: 'The proposals would safeguard the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, would preserve the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, and would have an acceptable impact on trees.' The Beckhams bought the grand property in Holland Park for £31.5 million in cash in 2013. With the help of designer Rose Uniacke, they are restoring the Grade II listed mansion to its former glory. It is a slow process with photos sent to the council last year showing the house had been stripped ahead of its overhaul. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria's shoe collection.

Awel Manyang, who is recovering in hospital, believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water.

Awel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water.

'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday. Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west. It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard. Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday. Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman. Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun. 'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.'

21,"Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. The SNP leader has denied telling French ambassador Sylvie Bermann that she would prefer David Cameron to remain in Number 10 while suggesting that Ed Miliband was not Prime Minister material. Ms Sturgeon told supporters at a rally in Glasgow today that she had written to Sir Jeremy to demand an official investigation. Scroll down for video. Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate the leaked memo. She told supporters in Glasgow today that the Westminster establishment were afraid of the SNP's rise and called on Ed Miliband to commit to 'locking out' David Cameron from Downing Street next month. Ms Sturgeon completely denied claims that she secretly hoped David Cameron would win the election. She claimed that the story was a sign of 'panic' within the Westminster establishment over the surge of support for her party. She then called on Mr Miliband to publicly commit to working with the SNP to 'lock out' Mr Cameron from Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament. Ms Sturgeon described the account of her conversation with the French ambassador as '100 per cent untrue'. The memo was published in the Daily Telegraph was written by a British civil servant following a conversation with consul-general Pierre-Alain Coffinier regarding the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and ambassador Sylvie Bermann, who was on her first visit to Scotland in February. According to the memo: 'Discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation, with the FM stating that she wouldn't want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she'd rather see David Cameron remain as PM.' The note went on to say that Ms Sturgeon had said she did not think Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'prime minister material'. The civil servant added: 'I have to admit that I'm not sure that the FM's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that, so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation'. Mr Coffinier - who was at the meeting - told Sky News that he had no recollection of Ms Sturgeon's alleged comments. He said: 'I do not know where this comes from, because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference.' David Cameron, pictured today, said any deal between Labour and the SNP would be a 'chaos alliance' A spokesman for the Ms Bermann said: 'While the Ambassador and First Minister, some time ago, discussed the political situation, Ms Sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister.' Attending an anti-nuclear rally in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: ""This story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the French Ambassador and Consul General. 'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as ‘prime minister material’, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: ‘The first minister confessed that she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material).’ She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal. Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority. Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.
","SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon dismissed claims she wants a Tory victory. She claimed the leaked memo is down to Westminster's fear of the SNP. She called on Ed Miliband to commit to a deal to 'lock out' David Cameron. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has announced a full investigation.

'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as ‘prime minister material’, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: ‘The first minister confessed that she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material).’ She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal. Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority. Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.
",,"The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has been caught red-handed by a leaked memo which exposed her preference for David Cameron over Ed Miliband. She denied the claims but Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has announced a full investigation into the matter. Sturgeon has been accused of secretly hoping for a Tory victory in the upcoming election, a fact that only came to light due to the 'leaked' memo from a British civil servant following a conversation with Sylvie Bermann, the French ambassador in Scotland. The SNP's opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum.",1,1,0,1,1
22,"Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson admits he must 'improve as a man' after his fellow professionals appeared to choose him as the most unpopular player on the PGA Tour. An ESPN.com survey of 103 tour professionals - 21 of whom were major champions - anonymously answered questions on a wide range of topics, including which player they would not help in a fight in the car park. Watson, who is chasing a third green jacket at Augusta this week, got double the number of responses (22.6 per cent) of second-place finisher Patrick Reed (11 per cent), with Rory Sabbatini third and Robert Allenby fourth. Bubba Watson speaks during his press conference at Augusta National on Tuesday. The reigning champion skips a ball across the water on the 16th hole during a practice round. Watson has won two green jackets but not a popularity contest among his peers. Asked on Tuesday whether the survey results irritated him, Watson replied: 'No, I take it as I need to improve as a man. I take it with pride. I need to get better. 'And I think over my career, since my rookie season to now, I've gotten better. 'But obviously there's more room for me to improve as a man, and hopefully the next year or the year after I will. 'It's a challenge. It's great. I'm glad that it came out and it's going to help me improve. 'So if it's a bad thing and people don't like me, then I've got to improve and prove them wrong.' Watson walks down the 12th fairway with Geoff Ogilvy of Australia as he gears up for the defence of his title. Patrick Reed, the self-assured American, came second in the players' unpopularity poll. Watson admitted he had been involved in 'some mess ups' on Tour but said he did not dislike any of his professional peers. 'I had the same question asked to me, so I answered that question,' Watson said. 'I put my name on there too, because I'm not going to call out anybody, there's nobody I dislike on Tour. 'I dislike them if they beat me, but I don't dislike them as a person. 'So I put my own name down there. So one of those names were me; I wrote it down myself. 'Obviously, I've never been in a fight in my life, so if I was in a fight, it was my fault. 'I caused somebody to get angry. So yeah, I wouldn't help myself either.'
","Bubba Watson was voted most unpopular golfer by his fellow pros. Survey asked which player they would not help if they were in a fight. Anonymous questionnaire saw reigning Masters champion come top. Watson said he took the result 'with pride' American defends his title as the 79th Masters tees off on Thursday.

It's a lot better, getting off the crutches, out of the brace and being able to move more on the bike and do some work in the pool. 'I couldn't move my leg for a month or so after the operation. I was at 90 degrees and I couldn't really do any more, but doing work where I can move now is good.

A disgusted member of the public snapped the man on his mobile phone after spotting him using the field as a makeshift toilet.

An ambulance service has apologised to the family of a woman who died after errors by emergency call operators meant she was not classed as having a life-threatening condition. David Priestley called 999 three times and had to wait an hour for an ambulance to reach his wife Diane, who was struggling to breathe and whose tongue and lips had turned blue. An investigation has found that an ambulance should have been given a response priority of eight minutes to reach the 57-year-old at her home in Shildon, County Durham. Instead, a longer 30 minute response time was assigned - which North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) still failed to meet - and the grandmother-of-nine died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on arrival at Darlington Memorial Hospital. In a letter to Mr Priestley, NEAS admitted: 'The delay in an ambulance arriving was initially due to the call handler error which resulted in an incorrect priority. 'However, as already acknowledged, we failed to attend within the timescale for the case priority that was in place. 'This was as a result of high demand on that day for emergency responses, compounded by a lack of resources to meet that demand.' Mr Priestley, 59, said he remains tormented by the thought his wife might have survived had paramedics reached her sooner on the afternoon of Saturday, September 30, last year. He described his wife of 40 years as his best friend. He added: 'It's like they say don't get bad on a weekend, as you won't get the proper treatment. 'She was my life. We did everything together.'
