"( cnn ) there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today's jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of isis, the self - anointed islamic state, or boko haram, the nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to isis. This new wave of violent islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a `` caliphate,'' a sharia - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of islam. Yazidi girls who slipped isis after its siege of mount sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for isis fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by human rights watch found `` a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by isis forces,'' actions that the group says `` are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.'

Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to workplace relations productivity commission. ` their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part - time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National secretary of the transport workers' union, tony sheldon, accused aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the workplace relations productivity commission, in which it recommended that the national employment standards be amended to `enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees `overwhelmingly supported' and `preferred' the proposals. ` aldi's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' david zalunardo, aldi's managing director, wrote. However mr sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to `strip workers of their rights'. ` the transport workers' union and its members acted against this billion - dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said.

"At first glance the rectangular island of por - bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison, with its regular structure and ruined sections. But it is unknown for certain what the rectangular island and its labyrinthine ruins, located in a lake in deepest siberia, was actually used for when it was built 1, 300 years ago.

The mysterious island, por - bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern siberia. A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined. The fortress is located about 3, 800 km from moscow near the mongolian border.

Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football. When he has started in the premier league or champions league, lambert and liverpool have impressed. On his first premier league start for liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth.

"In the aftermath of sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all - of - a - sudden, looks as outdated as a commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under - fire manager manuel pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for manchester city this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester city striker sergio aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by united at old trafford. The afternoon started so well for aguero and city when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes. Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for manchester city with david silva as de gea looks dejected. It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at old trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant sergio aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where city would have been without that century. Remember that title - winning goal against qpr in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from mario balotelli. Not kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had city fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what city paid what now looks like a bargain $ 38m for in 2011.

City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at old trafford.

Can manuel pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the chilean's future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross - town rivals would push chairman khaldoon al mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave city trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to champions league - - the very minimum requirement. Manuel pellegrini ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at city and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable. Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say city. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to city before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn murray ( right ) tormented city at selhurst park as they dropped out of the premier league title race.

Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. ` `it took so long,'' jordan said. ` `it moved so slowly.'

Co - pilot andreas lubitz, who purposefully crashed germanwings flight 9525, killing 150 people, had been treated for a psychiatric illness, it later emerged.

If lubitz's doctor did not alert germanwings, it must have been because lubitz did not seem like a threat. There are two arguments for why lubitz's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing lubitz's depression to his employer. First, functional doctor - patient relationships depend on trust.
