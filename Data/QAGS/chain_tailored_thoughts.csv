1,"( cnn ) after more than nine years of traveling through the solar system, nasa's new horizons spacecraft has sent back its first color image of pluto. The initial picture released on tuesday shows a couple of orange - tinged blobs : pluto and its largest moon, charon. But the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about pluto's remote, unexplored corner of the solar system. ` `this is pure exploration ; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes,'' said alan stern, new horizons' principal investigator. Launched in 2006, new horizons is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles. The probe is due to make its closest approach to pluto on july 14. ` `in an unprecedented flyby this july, our knowledge of what the pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and i have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries,'' said john grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the nasa science mission directorate. Discovered in 1930, pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system. But scientists have since revised that view because of pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of `` dwarf planet'' : a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. Pluto is 1, 400 miles wide, roughly half the width of the continental united states. At 3. 6 billion miles out in the solar system, it's about 40 times as far from the sun as earth is. By discovering more about pluto and its moons, new horizons will shed light on a little - known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants. The area, known as the kuiper belt, contains `` mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks,'' according","Pluto and its largest moon, charon.

1,"( cnn ) for years, when i'd tell new friends i was half - armenian, a puzzled look would cross their faces, before they'd ask something like, `` do you have a country?' ' or, when there was a spark of recognition, they'd chortle, `` ah, you're the people with the last names all ending in `ian'!' ' in fact, one of our most famous armenians, cher, was better known for her oscar - winning portrayals of italians, and had dropped her own identifying surname. The decimation of our people, too, was reduced to a footnote - - if we were lucky - - in tomes about world war i, when more than one million armenians were killed during the last days of the ottoman empire. Most of the time, though, the coverage was about how armenians and turks hate each other like cats and dogs, that the turks continue to deny that ethnic cleansing occurred, saying the armenians had hatched a rebellion, and that the leaders had no choice but to deport them from their homes and put them on the road that led to their deaths. Even adolf hitler had brushed us aside, uttering, just before invading poland in september 1939 : `` who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the armenians?' ' according to the former bureau chief of the associated press in berlin, louis lochner. Apparently he hadn't the anticipated the kardashian juggernaut. As kim kardashian, sister khloe and their two cousins recently toured armenia - - on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the mass killings, which is marked on april 24 - - they spotlighted a humanitarian crime that pope francis recently called `` the first genocide of the 20th century.'

1. **Cher and Turks were killed during the 100th anniversary of the 100th killings**: The document mentions Cher as a famous Armenian but does not state that she was killed. It also does not mention Turks being killed. This statement contradicts the document, which suggests an intrinsic hallucination.

2. **They were on the eve of the killings that killed one million Armenians**: The document discusses the mass killings of Armenians during World War I, but it does not state that anyone was on the eve of these killings in the present context. This could be interpreted as a factual hallucination since it implies a current event related to past killings.

3. **""Mother Armenia"" is the first genocide of Armenia**: The document refers to the Armenian genocide and mentions that Pope Francis called it ""the first genocide of the 20th century."" However, the phrase ""Mother Armenia"" is not mentioned in the document, which could imply a non-factual hallucination.

Given these points, the summary contains hallucinated content, including intrinsic hallucinations (regarding Cher and Turks being killed) and non-factual hallucinations (the phrase ""Mother Armenia""). 

Therefore, the response is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""Cher and turks were killed during the 100th anniversary of the 100th killings"" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document discusses the Armenian genocide, mentioning that over one million Armenians were killed during the last days of the Ottoman Empire. It references Cher as a famous Armenian but does not state that she was killed. It also discusses the relationship between Armenians and Turks, particularly in the context of the genocide and the denial of it by Turks. However, there is no mention of Turks being killed or any specific event involving Cher being killed.

2. **Content of the Summary**: The summary states that ""Cher and turks were killed during the 100th anniversary of the 100th killings."" This is a factual claim that is not supported by the document. The document does not mention any killings of Cher or Turks during the anniversary.

3. **Analysis of the Highlighted Sentence**: The highlighted sentence contains a factual inaccuracy. It implies that Cher was killed, which contradicts the information in the document. Additionally, it suggests that Turks were killed, which is not supported by the document either.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence contradicts the document and introduces information that is not present or supported by it.

1. **Content of the Document**: The document discusses the Armenian genocide, mentioning that over one million Armenians were killed during the last days of the Ottoman Empire. It references Cher as a famous Armenian but does not state that she was killed. The document also discusses the historical context of the genocide and mentions the Kardashians' visit to Armenia on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the mass killings, but it does not mention any Turks being killed or any killings related to Cher.

2. **Analysis of the Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement claims that ""Cher and turks were killed during the 100th anniversary of the 100th killings."" This is problematic for several reasons:
   - The document does not mention Cher being killed; in fact, it highlights her as a notable figure.
   - The document does not mention Turks being killed; it discusses the historical conflict between Armenians and Turks but does not imply that Turks were killed during the anniversary.
   - The phrase ""100th anniversary of the 100th killings"" is confusing and does not accurately reflect the content of the document, which refers to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.

3. **Conclusion**: The isolated statement contradicts the information provided in the document. It incorrectly states that Cher was killed and implies that Turks were killed, which is not supported by the document. Therefore, this statement is an intrinsic hallucination.

4,"( cnn ) about 20 hours after the boston marathon started monday, many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared. But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native maickel melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26. 2 miles just before 5 a. M. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39 - year - old as he walked down boylston street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, cnn affiliate wcvb - tv reported. Friends who were waiting for melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. ` `he wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,'' friend perla sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in chicago, new york, berlin and tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, wcvb - tv said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Melamed is one of about 30, 000 participants who raced in this year's marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found dzhokhar tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 boston bombings. On social media monday, spectators cheered for runners and the city, calling the marathon a symbol of strength and unity.",,Maickel melamed was born with muscular dystrophy. He was the last participant to win the race before 5 a.m. tuesday. He is a venezuelan dystrophy.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document:

1. **""Maickel melamed was born with muscular dystrophy.""** - This statement is supported by the document, which states that Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy.

2. **""He was the last participant to win the race before 5 a.m. Tuesday.""** - The document mentions that Melamed was the last participant to complete the race just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. However, the term ""win"" is misleading because the document does not state that he won the race; it only states that he completed it. This introduces a factual hallucination.

3. **""He is a venezuelan dystrophy.""** - This statement is unclear and seems to be a non-factual hallucination. It appears to be a typographical error or a misunderstanding, as it does not make sense in the context of the document. The document states he is a Venezuelan native and has muscular dystrophy, but it does not refer to him as a ""Venezuelan dystrophy.""

Based on this analysis, the summary contains both a factual hallucination (the use of ""win"" instead of ""complete"") and a non-factual hallucination (the unclear phrase ""venezuelan dystrophy""). Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Jordan celebrates his first wicket of this match, devon smith, as the west indies went to lunch 36 for two.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The rare form of cancer the father is battling is called neuroblastoma"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the summary.

1. The document states that the father is giving cannabis oil to his daughter who is battling a rare form of cancer called neuroblastoma. This information is clearly presented in the document.
2. The summary reiterates that the father has been charged and refused access to his daughter, and it mentions that despite his claims about the treatment, the father is battling neuroblastoma.

The isolated statement directly states that the rare form of cancer the father is battling is called neuroblastoma. This is explicitly supported by the document, as it clearly identifies neuroblastoma as the type of cancer affecting the daughter, not the father. However, the summary incorrectly implies that the father is battling neuroblastoma, which is not supported by the document.

Since the isolated statement is factually incorrect based on the document (the father is not battling neuroblastoma; it is his daughter who is), it contradicts the information provided.

Thus, the isolated statement is classified as [HALLUCINATED]."

Judge franz zibilich asked if durst was making that plea to both charges against him. Deguerin whispered again, and durst said, `yes, your honor.' The weapons arrest has kept durst in new orleans even though he waived extradition to california, where he's charged in the december 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison. Durst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in new orleans.

Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the nhs is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the health and social care information centre show that 22. 0 per cent of current gps gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19. 8 per cent in 2004. But the figure is 71 per cent in barking and dagenham, east london, 63 per cent in medway, kent, and 58 per cent in north lincolnshire. The nhs is facing a shortage because many gps are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The royal college of gps estimates that the nhs will need to hire at least 8, 000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The nhs employs 40, 584 gps, of whom 8, 941 are from overseas. This is up from 6, 921 in 2004 when there were 34, 855 family doctors in total. Dr richard vautrey, deputy chairman of the british medical association's gp committee, said : `we need gps from around the world to support the health service, and we simply don't train enough. ` we need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.'

2. The highlighted sentence makes a specific claim about the organization (Surrey) that is not supported by the document. Therefore, this is a factual hallucination because it presents information that cannot be verified from the document.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The trio played 133 tests."" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. **Context from the Document**: The document states that Alec Stewart played 133 tests, which is more than any England cricketer. It does not explicitly mention that Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss also played 133 tests, nor does it provide a combined total for the trio. The document focuses on each individual's achievements and roles, but it does not aggregate their test appearances.

15,"The number of hayfever sufferers in the uk is predicted to reach 20 million this summer, up a third from last year as warm weather bathes the country. For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told mailonline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told mailonline. And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31. 8 million sufferers. Dr jean emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told mailonline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, `depending on weather conditions'. She said : `if we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. ` grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the uk. ` high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added : `in addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from april to the end of august","Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year.

15,"( cnn ) how will the new `` fantastic four'' differ from the original movie of a decade ago? For starters, as a new trailer shows, sue and johnny storm's father initiates the project that ends up giving the foursome their powers. They also end up in another dimension, and we see the early flirtation between sue storm and reed richards as well. The movie, due out august 7, promises a very different take on the classic marvel comics characters, played this go - round by miles teller, kate mara, michael b. Jordan and jamie bell. We also get our first glimpse of the villainous dr. Doom in this new trailer, released sunday. Fans on twitter had mixed reactions. Check out the trailer here :. The trailerpalooza of `` star wars,'' `` batman v. Superman'' and `` fantastic four'' kept sci - fi and superhero fans chattering all weekend. Not to be outdone, the new trailer for `` jurassic world'' came out monday morning. It features even more of star chris pratt. Pratt's scientist character knows dinosaurs better than anyone. After a genetically modified mutant dinosaur escapes from an island theme park along with others, he takes charge of a mission to contain the dangerous creatures. ( the trailer also includes part of a scene that caused controversy after joss whedon called it `` sexist'' last week. ). The movie is first in the rampaging - dino franchise since `` jurassic park iii'' in 2001. And, as we see for the first time, the dinosaurs have learned to communicate with each other. Uh - oh.

16,"As california struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the sacramento - san joaquin delta - - and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations.

1. **Nadine Coyle and Coleen Rooney have joined forces with cancer research's race for life.** 
   - This statement is directly supported by the document, which mentions that both women are involved with Cancer Research's Race for Life.

2. **The race raises money to encourage women from across the UK.**
   - The document states that the race raises money for cancer research and encourages women to participate, but it does not explicitly say that the race raises money ""to encourage"" women.

   - This statement is supported by the document, which mentions that the ladies have lent their faces to the ad campaign for the Race for Life.

1. The document states that ""The race raises money that goes towards research into over 200 types of cancer affecting both men and women."" This indicates that the race does indeed raise money, but it is specifically for cancer research rather than solely to encourage women.

2. The document also mentions that the campaign aims to encourage women from across the UK to participate in the event, as it states, ""the ladies are hoping the shots will encourage women from across the uk, regardless of their age, shape or fitness level, to join the female-only event.""

At caernarfon crown court the former journalist, who was once named best mortgage broker in the midlands and wales, admitted two counts of fraud by lying to abbey national about the profitability of his business to secure the $ 847, 000 loan in march 2007. At an earlier hearing, he also pleaded guilty to five charges of deception after he used his position to inflate the salaries of five of his clients and help them obtain mortgages totalling $ 686, 000. Jonathan austin, defending, said copeland maintained that all the customers knew he had boosted their wages when making the applications. The barrister added that none of the loans had ever been defaulted upon. ` all these mortgages proved to be affordable,' the barrister said. ` the obligations were met.' Recorder gregory bull qc bailed copeland, of deganwy, llandudno, for sentencing later this year. But he went on to warn him : `you are not to read anything into the likely sentence.

The document mentions a California couple who put their table on eBay for $5,000 but does not state that it has yet to receive any bids. This part of the summary introduces confusion and does not accurately reflect the information in the document.

Here, the document mentions that Catalina ""hits her father's leg in frustration,"" which implies a physical action towards her father, but it does not specifically state that she ""kicks"" him. The term ""hits"" and ""kicks"" can be interpreted differently, and since the document does not explicitly say she kicks him, this could be seen as a factual hallucination.

22,"A tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting. Jonny bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a labour rival, theo blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, lazzaro pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand : jonny bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings. The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of camden council in north london, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after liberal democrat councillor martin elengorn was caught playing scrabble during a richmond council budget meeting in south - west london. Telling off : mayor of camden council, lazzaro pietragnoli, had to tell mr bucknell to stop eating. When he first noticed him eating, mr blackwell told his fellow councillors : `it appears that one of our tory colleagues is consuming a full sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. ` could i ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal.

1. **Jonny Bucknell's Age and Meal**: The summary states that Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying a meal in the council chamber when Theo Blackwell spotted him. This is supported by the document, which mentions his age and that he was caught eating a roast duck dinner during the council meeting.

2. **Alerting Other Councillors**: The summary correctly notes that Theo Blackwell alerted other councillors about Bucknell's behavior. This is also supported by the document.

3. **Forced to Put Down Cutlery**: The summary states that Bucknell was forced to put down his cutlery when a Labour rival was banned in the chamber. However, this is misleading. The document specifies that he was told to put down his cutlery by the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, not because he was banned, but because eating was against the rules of the chamber. This introduces a contradiction, as it implies that the rival was banned rather than the act of eating.

4. **Desire for Rule Change**: The summary mentions that Bucknell wants a rule change to allow eating at council meetings, which is supported by the document.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under - fire manager manuel pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for manchester city this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester city striker sergio aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by united at old trafford. The afternoon started so well for aguero and city when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes. Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for manchester city with david silva as de gea looks dejected. It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at old trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant sergio aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where city would have been without that century. Remember that title - winning goal against qpr in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from mario balotelli. Not kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had city fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what city paid what now looks like a bargain $ 38m for in 2011.

2. **""Sergio aguero scored 100 goals for manchester city in the 89th minute.""** - This statement is supported by the document. It mentions Aguero scoring his 100th goal in the 89th minute, which is accurate.

3. **""Manuel pellegrini's side were beaten in the premier league table.""** - This statement is somewhat vague but can be inferred from the context of the document, which discusses the aftermath of a defeat and speculation about the manager's future. However, it does not explicitly state that Pellegrini's side were beaten in the table, so it could be seen as a non-factual hallucination depending on interpretation.

2. **Imprisonment**: The summary mentions that he has been locked up in Goulburn's supermax jail for almost 20 years. This is also supported by the document.

3. **Book Release**: The summary states that Shipsey has released the book of his uncle's letters for ""those who want to read the facts."" This is supported by the document, which mentions Shipsey's intention behind releasing the book.

4. **Compilation of Letters**: The summary states that Shipsey is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. This part is misleading. The document states that ""The Milat Letters"" is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his nephew, but it does not imply that Shipsey himself is the compilation. This could be considered a factual hallucination as it misrepresents the relationship between Shipsey and the letters.

Former barcelona forward ronaldinho beat monterrey team-mate emanuel villa.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document provided.

1. **""Tigres monterrey scored two goals in queretaro's 4-0 win over club america.""**
   - This statement is incorrect. The document states that Queretaro won 4-0 against Club America, but it does not mention Tigres Monterrey scoring any goals in that match. Instead, it discusses Tigres Monterrey's separate match where they won 3-0 against Monterrey. This is an example of an intrinsic hallucination because it contradicts the information in the document.

2. **""The 2002 world cup winner rolled back up to fourth in the clausura.""**
   - This statement is misleading. The document mentions that Tigres Monterrey moved up to fourth in the Clausura, but it does not clarify that this is related to the 2002 World Cup winner, Ronaldinho. The phrasing suggests a direct connection that is not supported by the document. This could be seen as a factual hallucination since it implies a relationship that is not explicitly stated.

3. **""Former barcelona forward ronaldinho beat monterrey team-mate emanuel villa.""**
   - This statement is also misleading. The document states that Ronaldinho replaced Emanuel Villa in the match, but it does not indicate that he ""beat"" him in any context. This could be interpreted as a non-factual hallucination since it introduces a competitive element that is not present in the document.

The highlighted sentence claims that ""Tigres Monterrey scored two goals in Queretaro's 4-0 win over Club America."" This is incorrect because it implies that Tigres Monterrey was involved in the match against Club America, which they were not.

It also mentions Tigres Monterrey winning 3-0 against Monterrey, but it does not state that Tigres Monterrey scored two goals in the context of the Queretaro vs. Club America match.

2. **Summary Context**: The summary states that ""Tigres Monterrey scored two goals in Queretaro's 4-0 win over Club America."" This is incorrect because the document does not support that claim; it was Queretaro that scored four goals, not Tigres Monterrey.

The 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale - covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye - catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail.

34,"Can rickie lambert sue for restraint of trade? Brendan rodgers has killed off lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining liverpool - - why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker - - playing regularly in the premier league and scoring goals for southampton. He'd just been to a world cup. Rickie lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining liverpool despite their striking problems. Brendan rodgers' decision to ignore lambert, in favour of mario balotelli, is completely illogical. This time last year lambert was about to play at a world cup for england but his stock has fallen since. For rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware lambert isn't luis suarez, i know he's not a world - class striker. Lambert missed out on saturday at west brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see mario balotelli get yet another chance. The england striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of premier league minutes on the pitch lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six - and - a - half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football. When he has started in the premier league or champions league, lambert and liverpool have impressed. On his first premier league start for liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver.

1. **Brendan rodgers' decision to ignore lambert sue off lambert's career.** 
   - This statement is somewhat unclear and seems to contain a grammatical error (""sue off""). However, the document does mention that Brendan Rodgers has negatively impacted Lambert's career by not giving him opportunities, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the summary. This part is supported, but the phrasing is awkward.

2. **England striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season.**

However, it does not explicitly state that he was physically present at the match or at the location of West Brom.

2. The highlighted sentence states that Mr. Rowley issued a warning of new tactics in ""chaotic"" terror attacks with Al Qaeda. However, the context of the document primarily focuses on ISIS and their methods, while mentioning Al Qaeda in relation to past attacks.
3. The isolated statement claims that ""The warning pertains to Al Qaeda."" This suggests that the warning is specifically about Al Qaeda, which is not entirely accurate based on the document. The warning is more about ISIS and their evolving tactics, with Al Qaeda mentioned as a point of reference rather than the main focus of the warning.

Given this analysis, the isolated statement misrepresents the focus of the warning, which is primarily about ISIS rather than Al Qaeda. Therefore, it can be classified as an intrinsic hallucination.

36,"How neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians. One theory is that early modern humans `bullied' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west europe and west asia around 40, 000 years ago. They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era. Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe. But the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japan argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts. ` we're not so special, i don't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said dr seiji kadowaki, first author of the study from nagoya university, japan. On the left is a map of the levant showing the locations of the early ahmarian - related sites analysed in this study. Neanderthals ( reconstruction right ) may not have been as dim - witted as first believe, claims the study. The early ahmarian culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears. Researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west asia to europe, where neanderthals were living.

2. **He kissed the teenager after class and groped her in his car.**
   - This is also supported by the document, which mentions that he kissed the teenager after class and groped her in his car.

3. **Shorter offender, 71, jailed in May last year after being convicted of indecent assaults between 1977 and 1984.**
   - This part of the summary contains hallucinated content. The document states that Paul Shorter is 31 years old and does not mention any conviction or jail time related to indecent assaults between 1977 and 1984. The mention of ""offender, 71"" appears to refer to Max Clifford, who is a different individual mentioned in the document, and the timeline provided does not match the context of Paul Shorter's case.

Therefore, the response is [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and the highlighted sentence.

The highlighted sentence states: ""Shorter, 71, was jailed in May last year after being convicted of indecent assaults between 1977 and 1984."" This information is not found in the document. In fact, the document refers to Shorter as 31 years old and does not mention any past convictions or a jail sentence related to the years 1977 to 1984.

It specifically mentions that Chang and the child's grandmother, Nguyen, incapacitated the child's mother at her home in Des Moines, Washington, bound her with plastic ties, and then took the toddler, leaving the mother locked in a cupboard. 

The highlighted sentence states exactly this information: it mentions Chang and Nguyen, the incapacitation of the child's mother, the location (Des Moines, Washington), the binding with plastic ties, and the act of taking the toddler while leaving the mother locked up.

Since the highlighted sentence is directly supported by the details provided in the document, it is not hallucinated.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is [SUPPORTED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""His sister was having a night out with her boyfriend"" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

1. The document states that John Truong thought he was helping his sister have a nice night out with her boyfriend. This indicates that Truong believed his sister was going out with her boyfriend, but it does not confirm that she actually was having a night out. The phrasing suggests that this was Truong's perception rather than an established fact.

2. The isolated statement claims that ""His sister was having a night out with her boyfriend."" This statement implies that the sister was indeed out with her boyfriend, which is not definitively supported by the document. The document only reflects Truong's belief and does not provide evidence that the sister was actually on a date.

3. Since the isolated statement presents a definitive assertion that is not confirmed by the document, it can be classified as a factual hallucination. The document does not support the claim that the sister was actually having a night out; it only reflects Truong's misunderstanding of the situation.

His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the workplace relations productivity commission, in which it recommended that the national employment standards be amended to `enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees `overwhelmingly supported' and `preferred' the proposals. ` aldi's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' david zalunardo, aldi's managing director, wrote. However mr sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to `strip workers of their rights'. ` the transport workers' union and its members acted against this billion - dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said.

And there is unceasing public praise for the younger `dear leader,'' including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the north confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime.

Similarly, another article published in time said : `german privacy laws let pilot `hide' his illness from employers.'

The discovery sparked a debate over whether airlines should be given greater access to pilots' medical records. Mr montgomery believes that current laws are appropriate, since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people's lives at risk. If lubitz's doctor did not alert germanwings, it must have been because lubitz did not seem like a threat. There are two arguments for why lubitz's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing lubitz's depression to his employer. First, functional doctor - patient relationships depend on trust.

43,"( cnn ) there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today's jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of isis, the self - anointed islamic state, or boko haram, the nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to isis. This new wave of violent islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a `` caliphate,'' a sharia - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of islam. Yazidi girls who slipped isis after its siege of mount sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for isis fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by human rights watch found `` a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by isis forces,'' actions that the group says `` are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.' ' in nigeria, boko haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2, 000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to amnesty",,"Boko haram : isis, the self-anointed islamic state, is a strategy for the jihadi chiefs. They say the men' treatment of their female victims treat women in radical strategy. They say boko haram is one of the world's most popular islamist groups.",1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary in relation to the document provided.

1. **Boko Haram and ISIS**: The summary mentions Boko Haram and ISIS, which are indeed discussed in the document. However, the phrasing in the summary (""isis, the self-anointed islamic state, is a strategy for the jihadi chiefs"") is unclear and does not accurately reflect the document's content. The document describes ISIS and Boko Haram's treatment of women as part of their broader strategy, but it does not state that ISIS itself is a ""strategy.""

2. **Treatment of Female Victims**: The summary states, ""They say the men' treatment of their female victims treat women in radical strategy."" This sentence is confusing and does not clearly convey the document's message about the systematic abuse of women by these groups. The document emphasizes that the treatment of women is part of a larger plan, but the summary's wording is convoluted and does not accurately represent this idea.

3. **Popularity of Boko Haram**: The summary claims, ""they say boko haram is one of the world's most popular islamist groups."" This statement is not supported by the document. The document discusses the actions of Boko Haram but does not mention its popularity or make any claims about its status in relation to other groups.

Instead, it describes the treatment of women as part of a larger plan or strategy but does not equate ISIS itself to a strategy.
3. The phrasing in the highlighted sentence suggests a direct equivalence or identification of ISIS as a strategy, which is not supported by the document. The document discusses the strategies of these groups but does not claim that ISIS itself is a strategy.

Given this analysis, the highlighted sentence does not accurately reflect the content of the document and introduces a concept that is not supported by the text. Therefore, it can be classified as a factual hallucination.

The document states that ""Sterling said on wednesday that he was not ready to sign a new $100,000-a-week deal at liverpool,"" but it does not attribute this statement to Scholes. Instead, it is Sterling's own statement. Therefore, this part of the summary is not accurately represented and introduces a misattribution.

1. **Super Bowl Victory**: The summary states that the New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX in Glendale, Arizona, with Brady named as MVP for the third time in his fourth Super Bowl victory. This information is directly supported by the document.

2. **Brady's Absence**: The summary mentions that the Patriots said ""prior family commitments"" were the reason why Brady didn't attend the White House on Thursday. This is also directly supported by the document.

3. **Obama's Position**: The summary states, ""The president was a senator,"" which is a factual statement about Barack Obama’s past but is not directly supported by the document. The document mentions that Obama met Brady when he was a senator, but it does not state that he was a senator during the time of the visit. This could be considered a factual hallucination since it is verifiable but not inferable from the text.

4. **Super Bowl Records**: The summary includes that Brady has 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37. This specific phrasing is not found in the document. The document states that Brady is the all-time leader with 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions, but it does not specify ""on 37."" This could be seen as a factual hallucination since it introduces a specific detail that is not supported by the document.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains hallucinated content due to the statement about Obama being a senator and the specific phrasing regarding Brady's records.

Therefore, the response is: [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, let's analyze its components based on the provided document.

1. **""The president was a senator""**: This part of the sentence is supported by the document, which mentions that Tom Brady met Obama when he was a senator in 2005.

2. **""with 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37""**: This part of the sentence is also supported by the document, which states that Brady is the all-time leader with 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37.

However, the way the highlighted sentence is constructed implies that both pieces of information are connected in a way that suggests the president himself has the Super Bowl statistics, which is not the case. The document does not state that the president has any Super Bowl statistics; it only discusses Tom Brady's achievements.

Thus, the highlighted sentence contains a factual hallucination because it incorrectly attributes the Super Bowl statistics to the president rather than to Tom Brady.

Therefore, the highlighted sentence is classified as [HALLUCINATED].",1,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""The president had 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes."" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document and the context provided.

It also mentions President Barack Obama, who welcomed the Patriots to the White House, but it does not attribute any Super Bowl statistics to him.

2. **Highlighted Sentence**: The highlighted sentence states, ""The president was a senator with 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37."" This sentence is misleading because it incorrectly combines information about the president's past role as a senator with Tom Brady's Super Bowl statistics.

3. **Isolated Statement Analysis**: The isolated statement claims, ""The president had 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes."" This is factually incorrect because the president (Barack Obama) did not play in the Super Bowl and therefore cannot have any Super Bowl touchdown passes. This statement contradicts the information in the document.

Based on this analysis, the isolated statement is an intrinsic hallucination because it contradicts the document's content regarding who holds the Super Bowl touchdown passes record.

2. **Second Statement**: ""The 21-year-old held his nerve in sunday's final round.""
   - This is also supported by the document, which mentions that Spieth held his nerve during the final round.

3. **Third Statement**: ""Tiger woods' record of an 18-under 270 and four shots clear of the field.""
   - This statement is somewhat ambiguous. The document states that Spieth matched Tiger Woods' record of an 18-under 270 and finished four shots clear of the field. However, the way this statement is phrased in the summary could imply that it is presenting Woods' record as a standalone fact without directly linking it to Spieth's achievement, which could be seen as a slight misrepresentation.

Overall, while the summary contains mostly supported statements, the phrasing of the last part could lead to confusion about the context of the record. However, it does not contradict the document nor does it introduce any entities that are not present in the document.

Thus, the summary does not contain hallucinated content.

Around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the charity and the veterinary poisons information service. Of those, 470 dogs died. Sick : around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014. Unlike crufts prizewinner jagger the irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well - meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate - - which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life - threatening anaemia. Nick sutton, a kennel club poisons expert, said : `there are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products - - particularly foods eaten by humans - - are fine for a dog to eat. ` many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much - loved pets.'

3. **Miller was booked into the Orange County jail on Thursday after an argument with her mother when she was killed.**
   - This part of the summary contains a factual inaccuracy. The document states that Trinity was involved in an argument with her mother before she got out of the vehicle and was subsequently struck by Miller. However, it does not state that Miller was booked into jail ""after an argument with her mother."" This implies a connection between Miller's booking and an argument that did not occur, as the argument was between Trinity and her mother, not involving Miller.

Given this analysis, the summary contains a factual hallucination regarding the circumstances of Miller's booking. Therefore, the correct classification is:

[HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the content of the document and the highlighted sentence.

This sentence is misleading because it implies that Miller had an argument with her mother, which is not supported by the document.

3. **Isolated Statement**: The isolated statement claims that ""Miller had an argument with her mother."" This is not supported by the document, as it only discusses Trinity's argument with her mother and does not provide any information about Miller having a similar argument.

57,"Goodness knows how many times at white hart lane i've felt like falling to my knees at the back of the west stand and banging my head on the floor. I've lost count. A lifetime of following spurs can have that effect on you, especially in recent years. Last saturday's inept capitulation to aston villa was the most recent occasion : a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local jobcentre half an hour before the kick - off. Stephen dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month. Had i actually gone through with it, however, within seconds i'd have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit. They are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells. And given football's tragic history, from ibrox to hillsborough, their caution is well - merited. So it was surprising, to say the least, to see that photograph of two muslim liverpool supporters praying to mecca at half - time in an fa cup match. They had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand, apparently with the full consent of safety staff. One of the men, solicitor asif bodi, 46, from preston, explained that because the televised game didn't kick off until 4pm, the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground. So perhaps we can point the finger at television. Matches are shifted all over the shop by the schedulers, for purely commercial reasons. For instance, those irritating lunchtime games are designed for the benefit of bookmakers and betting syndicates in the far east, not season ticket holders. Travelling fans often complain that evening games mean it is impossible for them to catch the last train home. But this may be the first",,Stephen dodd took asif bodi and abubakar bhula at anfield last month. The game was captured on a mobile phone camera by liverpool supporter stephen dodd.

Final judgment: [SUPPORTED]"
60,"It is not a match to decide the title, as has been the case in earlier seasons. But the manchester derby this sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at old trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. Can manuel pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the chilean's future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross - town rivals would push chairman khaldoon al mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave city trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to champions league - - the very minimum requirement. Manuel pellegrini ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at city and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable. Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say city. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to city before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn murray ( right ) tormented city at selhurst park as they dropped out of the premier league title race. Would victory dispel any lingering doubts about louis van gaal? Quite likely. Three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of tottenham, liverpool",,City have won the last four at manchester derby this sunday. Manuel pellegrini's side have not lost five in a row to city. Louis van gaal's side are currently in the premier league.,1,1,1,1,1,"Let's analyze the summary step-by-step in relation to the document provided.

1. **""City have won the last four at manchester derby this sunday.""**
   - The document states that ""City have won the last four contests between the sides,"" which supports this statement. However, it does not explicitly confirm that these wins were all at the Manchester derby this Sunday. This could be interpreted as a factual hallucination since the summary implies a specific context (this Sunday) that is not directly supported by the document.

2. **""Manuel pellegrini's side have not lost five in a row to city.""**
   - The document mentions that ""United have never lost five in a row to city before,"" which implies that Pellegrini's side has not lost five in a row to United. This statement is supported by the document.

3. **""Louis van gaal's side are currently in the premier league.""**
   - The document discusses the context of the Manchester derby and mentions the teams involved, including United, who are managed by Louis van Gaal. While it is reasonable to infer that they are in the Premier League given the context, the document does not explicitly state this. This could be seen as a factual hallucination since it is not directly verifiable from the text.

Based on this analysis, the summary contains elements that are not fully supported by the document, particularly the first and third statements. Therefore, the summary does contain hallucinated content.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",1,"To determine whether the highlighted sentence ""Manuel Pellegrini's side have not lost five in a row to City"" is supported or hallucinated, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document states that ""City have won the last four contests between the sides"" and ""United have never lost five in a row to City before."" This indicates that while City has won the last four matches, United has not lost five consecutive matches to City.

2. The highlighted sentence refers to ""Manuel Pellegrini's side,"" which is Manchester City. However, the context of the document suggests that it is actually Manchester United that has not lost five in a row to City, not City itself.

3. Therefore, the highlighted sentence contradicts the information provided in the document, as it implies that City has not lost five in a row to themselves, which is nonsensical.

Based on this analysis, the highlighted sentence is an intrinsic hallucination because it contradicts the information in the document.

Final judgment: [HALLUCINATED]",0,"To determine whether the isolated statement ""Louis van Gaal's side are currently in the Premier League"" is hallucinated or supported, we need to analyze the document.

1. The document discusses the significance of the Manchester derby and mentions various aspects of the teams involved, including their recent performances and managerial pressures.
2. It specifically mentions that United (which refers to Louis van Gaal's side) is likely to finish in the top four, which implies they are competing in the Premier League.
3. The document does not explicitly state that Louis van Gaal's side is currently in the Premier League, but it can be inferred from the context that since they are competing for a top-four finish, they must be participating in the Premier League.

Given this reasoning, the isolated statement can be inferred from the document, making it supported.

Therefore, the isolated statement is [SUPPORTED]."
