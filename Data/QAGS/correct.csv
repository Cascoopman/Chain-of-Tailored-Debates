"( cnn ) after more than nine years of traveling through the solar system, nasa's new horizons spacecraft has sent back its first color image of pluto. The initial picture released on tuesday shows a couple of orange - tinged blobs : pluto and its largest moon, charon. But the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about pluto's remote, unexplored corner of the solar system. ` `this is pure exploration ; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes,'' said alan stern, new horizons' principal investigator. Launched in 2006, new horizons is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles. The probe is due to make its closest approach to pluto on july 14. ` `in an unprecedented flyby this july, our knowledge of what the pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and i have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries,'' said john grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the nasa science mission directorate. Discovered in 1930, pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system. But scientists have since revised that view because of pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of `` dwarf planet'' : a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. Pluto is 1, 400 miles wide, roughly half the width of the continental united states. At 3. 6 billion miles out in the solar system, it's about 40 times as far from the sun as earth is. By discovering more about pluto and its moons, new horizons will shed light on a little - known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants. The area, known as the kuiper belt, contains `` mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks,'' according",correct,"Pluto and its largest moon, charon.

"( cnn ) just about now, north korea's enigmatic ruler was expected to be preparing to emerge from his fortified country for a visit to moscow to join celebrations next week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii in europe. The trip was highly anticipated. After all, this was to have been kim's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father's death, and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery. But this week, russia announced that the trip had been canceled, with kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov saying thursday that moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen. He said that `` the decision is connected with north korean domestic affairs.' ' what could have changed kim's mind? It is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty, but a possible explanation is that kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position. And nervous dictators prefer to stay home. True, kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on earth. And there is unceasing public praise for the younger `dear leader,'' including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the north confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime. Perhaps with the potential threats in mind, kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power. In 2013, kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle, jang song thaek, who had stood by his side from the day his father died.

And now a photographer has captured the finer details of these iridescent insects in stunning clarity, including the rainbow scales of their delicate wings. Some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon, while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges. Scroll down for video. These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth. The photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry. The 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale - covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye - catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail. The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail ( stock image ).

Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two - thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the nhs is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the health and social care information centre show that 22. 0 per cent of current gps gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19. 8 per cent in 2004. But the figure is 71 per cent in barking and dagenham, east london, 63 per cent in medway, kent, and 58 per cent in north lincolnshire. The nhs is facing a shortage because many gps are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The royal college of gps estimates that the nhs will need to hire at least 8, 000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The nhs employs 40, 584 gps, of whom 8, 941 are from overseas. This is up from 6, 921 in 2004 when there were 34, 855 family doctors in total.

"How neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians. One theory is that early modern humans `bullied' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west europe and west asia around 40, 000 years ago. They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era. Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe. But the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japan argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts. ` we're not so special, i don't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said dr seiji kadowaki, first author of the study from nagoya university, japan. On the left is a map of the levant showing the locations of the early ahmarian - related sites analysed in this study. Neanderthals ( reconstruction right ) may not have been as dim - witted as first believe, claims the study. The early ahmarian culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears. Researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west asia to europe, where neanderthals were living.

The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children's motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by goldsmiths university in london and ohio state university. More than 13, 000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research ( stock image shown ). Psychologists from goldsmiths university of london, and ohio state university in the us studied more than 13, 000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the uk, canada, japan, germany, russia and the us. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins' shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non - shared - environment factors had the largest effect on the children's motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact.

"The number of hayfever sufferers in the uk is predicted to reach 20 million this summer, up a third from last year as warm weather bathes the country. For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told mailonline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told mailonline. And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31. 8 million sufferers. Dr jean emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told mailonline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, `depending on weather conditions'. She said : `if we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. ` grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the uk. ` high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added : `in addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from april to the end of august",correct,"Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year.

"Tough stance : health minister marisol touraine wants to impose fines and prison sentences for inciting binge drinking. They look down on our food, our weather and even our language.

It has slammed the practice of going out to get drunk as an `anglo - saxon phenomenon' and says it is being copied by increasing numbers of youths on the continent. But critics have said it's a case of double standards for a country where children are encouraged to drink wine at the table from a relatively early age. The latest figures reveal that almost half of french 18 to 25 years olds have consumed alcohol with the sole aim of getting drunk - - compared to 33 per cent ten years ago. The rise in binging is particularly high among young women, soaring from eight per cent who admitted they had done it in 2005, to three times that number by 2015. Now france's state health watchdog has claimed the sharp increase is due to french youths copying the english. Francis bourdillon, head of the national institute of prevention and health education, said : `this is an anglo - saxon phenomenon that's starting to creep into the generation of the 15 - 24 - year - olds. ` consumption of alcohol in france is particularly worrying among young people and especially among young women. ` besides the obvious health concerns, binge drinking can also lead to violence against women, sometimes fatal drunken accidents, and unprotected sex.'
